This study applied machine learning classification models and explainable AI to uncover associations across diverse factors with chronic pain, psychological distress, and their co-occurrence in young adults. It also examined how associations vary when these conditions occur individually versus when they co-occur. Variable clusters were also obtained to identify latent subgroups. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the Norwegian Students' Health and Well-being Study (SHoT2018) were utilised. Three classification models (Logistic Regression, Tsetlin Machine, CatBoost) were developed separately for three mutually exclusive groups (chronic pain only, psychological distress only, and their co-occurrence), against a healthy group. Model performance was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and internal-external cross-validation using geographical regions as folds. Shapley values and odds ratios were applied to identify factors associated with conditions, with associations compared across them. Clause rules were obtained to search for variable clusters. Results: A total of 34,469 participants (mean age 22.9 years; 67.4% female) were included. Chronic pain, psychological distress, and co-occurrence were reported by 27.2%, 12.7%, and 26.7%, respectively. Models performed consistently across regions (AUC 0.70–0.72 for chronic pain, 0.92–0.93 for psychological distress, and 0.94–0.96 for co-occurrence. Explainable AI analyses identified females, perceived health status, and sleep disorders as factors associated with all conditions. Associations shifted when conditions co-occurred versus individually, with some negating each other while others combined, revealing distinct patterns for the co-occurring group. Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of studying these conditions both individually and simultaneously. Machine learning and explainable AI revealed unique associations that can help with early identification of subjects at risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chronic pain; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Psychological distress; Young adults","Diseases; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Medical problems; Applied machine learning; Areas under the curves; Chronic pain; Classification models; Co-occurrence; Condition; Explainable AI; Machine-learning; Psychological distress; Young adults; Learning systems; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; chronic pain; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; distress syndrome; drug use; explainable artificial intelligence; female; geography; health care utilization; health status; human; life satisfaction; lifestyle; machine learning; major clinical study; male; Norwegian (citizen); physical activity; sleep disorder; sociodemographics; young adult","","","","Borgman, Sofie, The Relationship Between Reported Pain and Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents, Journal of School Nursing, 36, 2, pp. 87-93, (2020); Vos, Theo, Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, The Lancet, 380, 9859, pp. 2163-2196, (2012); Soltani, Sabine, The Co-occurrence of Pediatric Chronic Pain and Depression: A Narrative Review and Conceptualization of Mutual Maintenance, Clinical Journal of Pain, 35, 7, pp. 633-643, (2019); Treede, Rolf Detlef, Chronic pain as a symptom or a disease: The IASP Classification of Chronic Pain for the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), Pain, 160, 1, pp. 19-27, (2019); Tegethoff, Marion, Comorbidity of Mental Disorders and Chronic Pain: Chronology of Onset in Adolescents of a National Representative Cohort, Journal of Pain, 16, 10, pp. 1054-1064, (2015); Paediatr Neonatal Pain, (2023); Lötsch, Jörn C., Machine learning in pain research, Pain, 159, 4, pp. 623-630, (2018); Barroga, Edward F., Research study designs: An appraisal for peer reviewers and science editors, European Science Editing, 39, 2, pp. 44-45, (2013); Helfet, David Leonard, Big Data: the paradigm shift needed to revolutionize musculoskeletal clinical research, American Journal of Orthopedics, 43, 9, pp. 399-400, (2014); Allgaier, Johannes, How does the model make predictions?

Studies have proposed using the T-score and patient information as key diagnostic factors. However, these techniques have either been time-consuming or have required separate calculation processes after collecting each parameter. To address this gap, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based web application that automates the collection of data, classification of the lumbar spine 3 (L3) slices, segmentation of the subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and muscle areas in the classified L3 slices, and quantitative analysis of the segmented areas. Methods: We developed an automated lumbar spine slice classification model using the CNN (EfficientNetV2) algorithm and an automated domain segmentation model to identify the subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, and muscle areas using the U-NET algorithm. These models were used to identify L3 slices from abdominal computed tomography images and divide the images into the three-segmented domains for sarcopenia diagnosis. Additionally, we developed an algorithm for the calculation of T-Score calculated as (measurement value-Young adult mean)/(Young adult SD) using the Aggregation Pipeline by MongoDB, with the mean and standard deviation for skeletal muscle area (SMA), SMA/height2, SMA/weight, and SMA/body mass index (BMI) for both sexes and different age groups. Results: The proposed system demonstrated high accuracy and precision, with an overall accuracy of 97.5% in classifying L3 slices and a segmentation accuracy of 92% for muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat areas. The T-Score-based analysis provided reliable diagnostic thresholds for sarcopenia, facilitating consistent and accurate assessments. Our diagnostic cutoff points for each index were as follows: SMA (-1.0: 152.55, -2.0: 125.89), SMA/height² (-1.0: 38.84, -2.0: 14.50), SMA/weight (-1.0: 2.14, -2.0: 1.89), and SMA/BMI (-1.0: 6.10, -2.0: 5.18) for men; SMA (-1.0: 96.08, -2.0: 76.96), SMA/height² (-1.0: 37.20, -2.0: 29.36), SMA/weight (-1.0: 1.80, -2.0: 1.61), and SMA/BMI (-1.0: 4.56, -2.0: 4.01) for women. SMA/BMI best reflected the loss of muscle mass in healthy populations by age, showing a more remarkable decrease in muscle mass in men than in women. The values for men gradually decreased after their 20s, and that for women gradually decreased after their 40s, which progressed to a more dramatic decline in the 70s for both sexes. Conclusion: This AI-based web application addresses the limitations of previous diagnostic techniques by automatically analyzing medical images for the classification, segmentation, and calculation of T-scores. The study findings provide a more reliable and accurate diagnostic technique for sarcopenia that can consequently impact patient treatment and outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Muscle; Reference values; Sarcopenia; Tomography","adult; aged; algorithm; artificial intelligence; diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; female; human; lumbar vertebra; male; middle aged; retrospective study; sarcopenia; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sarcopenia; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (2021R1A5A8029876) and the Ulsan University Hospital Research Grant (UUH-2024-07).","Chen, Liang-Kung, Sarcopenia in Asia: Consensus report of the Asian working group for sarcopenia, Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, 15, 2, pp. 95-101, (2014); Chen, Liang-Kung, Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia: 2019 Consensus Update on Sarcopenia Diagnosis and Treatment, Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, 21, 3, pp. 300-307.e2, (2020); Cruz-Jentoft, Alfonso José, Sarcopenia: European consensus on definition and diagnosis, Age and Ageing, 39, 4, pp. 412-423, (2010); Bedrikovetski, Sergei, Artificial intelligence for body composition and sarcopenia evaluation on computed tomography: A systematic review and meta-analysis, European Journal of Radiology, 149, (2022); Boutin, Robert Downey, Sarcopenia: Current concepts and imaging implications, American Journal of Roentgenology, 205, 3, pp. W255-W266, (2015); Lortie, Jevin, The effect of computed tomography parameters on sarcopenia and myosteatosis assessment: a scoping review, Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle, 13, 6, pp. 2807-2819, (2022); Fielding, Roger A., Sarcopenia: An Undiagnosed Condition in Older Adults.

The question of whether medical education is fully preparing trainees to adapt to potential changes from AI technology in clinical practice remains unanswered, and the influence of AI on medical students’ career preferences remains unclear. Understanding the gap between students’ interest in and knowledge of AI may help inform the medical curriculum structure. Methods: A total of 354 medical students were surveyed to investigate their knowledge of, exposure to, and interest in the role of AI in health care. Students were questioned about the anticipated impact of AI on medical specialties and their career preferences. Results: Most students (65%) were interested in the role of AI in medicine, but only 23% had received formal education in AI based on reliable scientific resources. Despite their interest and willingness to learn, only 20.1% of students reported that their school offered resources enabling them to explore the use of AI in medicine. They relied mainly on informal information sources, including social media, and few students understood fundamental AI concepts or could cite clinically relevant AI research. Students who cited more scientific primary sources (rather than online media) exhibited significantly higher self-reported understanding of AI concepts in the context of medicine. Interestingly, students who had received more exposure to AI courses reported higher levels of skepticism regarding AI and were less eager to learn more about it. Radiology and pathology were perceived to be the fields most strongly affected by AI. Students reported that their overall choice of specialty was not impacted by AI. Conclusion: Formal AI education seems inadequate despite students’ enthusiasm concerning the application of such technology in clinical practice. Medical curricula should evolve to promote structured, evidence-based AI literacy to enable students to understand the potential applications of AI in health care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; Artificial intelligence; Clinical practice curriculum; Health care; Medical education; Pathology; Radiology; Specialty choice","adult; artificial intelligence; curriculum; decision making; female; human; male; medical education; medical student; psychology; questionnaire; Saudi Arabia; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Career Choice; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Male; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Hamet, Pavel, Artificial intelligence in medicine, Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental, 69, pp. S36-S40, (2017); Lecun, Yann Le, Deep learning, Nature, 521, 7553, pp. 436-444, (2015); Roppelt, Julia Stefanie, Artificial intelligence in healthcare institutions: A systematic literature review on influencing factors, Technology in Society, 76, (2024); Esteva, Andre, Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks, Nature, 542, 7639, pp. 115-118, (2017); Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education, (2025); Reeder, Kristen, Impact of artificial intelligence on US medical students' choice of radiology, Clinical Imaging, 81, pp. 67-71, (2022); Liu, David Shalom, Perceptions of US Medical Students on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Mixed Methods Survey Study, JMIR Medical Education, 8, 4, (2022); Buabbas, Ali J., Investigating Students’ Perceptions towards Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education, Healthcare (Switzerland), 11, 9, (2023); Park, Christian J., Medical Student Perspectives on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Practice of Medicine, Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology, 50, 5, pp. 614-619, (2021); Alwadani, Fahad, Attitude and Understanding of Artificial Intelligence Among Saudi Medical Students: An Online Cross-Sectional Study, Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare, 17, pp. 1887-1899, (2024)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39881303","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217357211"

The study aimed to assess students’ perceptions regarding the credibility and effectiveness of AI as a learning tool and to explore the dynamics of integrating AI in medical education. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out across medical colleges in Pakistan. A 26-question survey was developed using Google Forms from previously validated studies. The survey assessed demographics of participants, basic understanding of AI, AI as a learning tool in medical education and socio-ethical impacts of the use of AI. The data was analyzed using SPSS (v 26.0) to derive descriptive and inferential statistics. Result: A total of 702 medical students aged 18 to 26 years (mean age 20.50 ± 1.6 years) participated in the study. The findings revealed a generally favorable attitude towards AI among medical students (80.3%), with the majority considering it an effective (60.8%) and credible (58.4%) learning tool in medical education. Students agreed that AI learning optimized their study time (60.3%) and provided up-to-date medical information (63.1%). Notably, 65.7% of students found AI more efficient in helping them grasp medical concepts compared to traditional tools like books and lectures, while 66.8% reported receiving more accurate answers to their medical inquiries through AI. The study highlighted that medical students view traditional tools as becoming increasingly outdated (59%), emphasizing the importance of integrating AI into medical education and creating dedicated AI tools (80%) for the medical education. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that AI is an effective and credible tool in medical education, offering personalized learning experiences and improved educational outcomes. AI tools are helping students learn medical concepts by cutting down on study-time, providing accurate answers, and ultimately improving study outcomes. We recommend developing dedicated AI tools for medical education and their formal integration into medical curricula, along with appropriate regulatory oversight to ensure AI can enhance human abilities rather than acting as a replacement for humans. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Educational technology: healthcare; Machine learning; Medical education","adolescent; adult; artificial intelligence; cross-sectional study; curriculum; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; medical education; medical student; Pakistan; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Male; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Jha, N., Undergraduate Medical Students’ and Interns’ Knowledge and Perception of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Advances in Medical Education and Practice, 13, pp. 927-937, (2022); Topol, Eric J., High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence, Nature Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 44-56, (2019); Eysenbach, Gunther, The Role of ChatGPT, Generative Language Models, and Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education: A Conversation With ChatGPT and a Call for Papers, JMIR Medical Education, 9, (2023); Avicenna J Health Sci; Li, Qianying, AI in medical education: medical student perception, curriculum recommendations and design suggestions, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023); Lee, Juehea, Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review, Academic Medicine, 96, 11, pp. S62-S70, (2021); Jmir Med Educ, (2019); Lee, Hyunsu, The rise of ChatGPT: Exploring its potential in medical education, Anatomical Sciences Education, 17, 5, pp. 926-931, (2024); Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A., Large Language Models in Medical Education: Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions, JMIR Medical Education, 9, (2023); Zhang, Wei, AI in Medical Education: Global situation, effects and challenges, Education and Information Technologies, 29, 4, pp. 4611-4633, (2024)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39833834","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216440005"

Background: Artificial Intelligence is increasingly utilized in medical education and clinical profession training. However, since its introduction, ChatGPT remains relatively unexplored in terms of health profession students' acceptance of its use in education and practice. Design: This study employed a mixed-methods approach, using a web-based survey. Methods: The study involved a convenience sample recruited through various methods, including Faculty of Medicine announcements, social media, and snowball sampling, during the second semester (March to June 2023). Data were collected using a structured questionnaire with closed-ended questions and three open-ended questions. The final sample comprised 217 undergraduate health profession students, including 73 (33.6%) nursing students, 65 (30.0%) medical students, and 79 (36.4%) occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy students. Results: Among the surveyed students, 86.2% were familiar with ChatGPT, with generally positive perceptions as reflected by a mean score of 4.04 (SD = 0.62) on a scale of 1 to 5. Positive feedback was particularly noted with respect to ChatGPT's role in information retrieval and summarization. The qualitative data revealed three main themes: experiences with ChatGPT, its impact on the quality of healthcare, and its integration into the curriculum. The findings highlight benefits such as serving as a convenient tool for accessing information, reducing human errors, and fostering innovative learning approaches. However, they also underscore areas of concern, including ethical considerations, challenges in fostering critical thinking, and issues related to verification. The absence of significant differences between the different fields of study indicates consistent perceptions across nursing, medicine, and other health profession students. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the necessity for continuous refinement to enhance ChatGPT's accuracy, reliability, and alignment with the diverse educational needs of health professions. These insights not only deepen our understanding of student perceptions of ChatGPT in healthcare education but also have significant implications for the future integration of AI in health profession practice. The study emphasizes the importance of a careful balance between leveraging the benefits of AI tools and addressing ethical and pedagogical concerns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; ChatGPT; Health Profession Students; Integration; Medical Education; Mixed-Methods Study; Perception","adult; artificial intelligence; curriculum; female; health personnel attitude; health student; human; male; medical student; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Male; Students, Health Occupations; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Medrxiv, (2025); J Innov Knowl, (2023); Aung, Yuri Yin Moe, The promise of artificial intelligence: A review of the opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence in healthcare, British Medical Bulletin, 139, 1, pp. 4-15, (2021); Medrxiv, (2023); Blease, Charlotte Rosalind, Machine learning in medical education: A survey of the experiences and opinions of medical students in Ireland, BMJ Health and Care Informatics, 29, 1, (2022); Deconstructing Student Perceptions of Generative AI Genai Through an Expectancy Value Theory Evt Based Instrument, (2023); AI Generation Gap are Gen Z Students More Interested in Adopting Generative AI Such as Chatgpt in Teaching and Learning than their Gen X and Millennial Generation Teachers, (2023); Cotton, Debby R.E., Chatting and cheating: Ensuring academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 61, 2, pp. 228-239, (2024); Dave, Manàs, Artificial intelligence in healthcare and education, British Dental Journal, 234, 10, pp. 761-764, (2023); Dave, Tirth, ChatGPT in medicine: an overview of its applications, advantages, limitations, future prospects, and ethical considerations, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 6, (2023)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39833868","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216439827"

Exposure to extreme weather events, displacement, food insecurity, and social isolation contribute to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and disrupted development. Pediatric healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to identify and respond to these impacts; however, many lack the necessary education and tools to do so effectively. Concurrently, artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to close knowledge gaps by synthesizing evidence, personalizing content, and rapidly generating high-quality educational materials. Recent Findings: This article explores how AI can support pediatric mental health in the context of climate change by identifying educational needs among healthcare providers, families, and communities. It outlines strategies for utilizing AI platforms to identify knowledge gaps, synthesize relevant research, and create targeted content in various formats, including fact sheets, infographics, podcasts, and presentations. The article also explains the mechanics behind AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models, while emphasizing the critical role of human oversight in ensuring accuracy, cultural competence, and ethical integrity. Key considerations such as authorship, plagiarism, bias, and transparency are addressed to guide the responsible use of AI. Summary: Ultimately, the integration of AI into pediatric education must complement, rather than replace, the human connection that is central to child healthcare. By combining innovative technology with compassionate, evidence-informed care, pediatricians can better support the mental health of young patients in a rapidly changing climate, while empowering families and communities with knowledge and tools that foster resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education; Climate change and health; Eco-Anxiety in Children; Health Communication; Pediatric Mental Health; Resilience and Coping Strategies","adolescent; anxiety; artificial intelligence; child; climate change; congenital malformation; coping; Coping Strategy Questionnaire; cultural competence; depression; developmental disorder; diagnosis; eco-anxiety; educational material; extreme weather; food insecurity; growth disorder; health care personnel; human; knowledge gap; large language model; machine learning; medical education; medical information; mental health; natural language processing; pediatrician; plagiarism; podcast; posttraumatic stress disorder; review; social isolation","","","","Proulx, Kerrie, Climate change impacts on child and adolescent health and well-being: A narrative review, Journal of Global Health, 14, (2024); Wu, Judy, Climate anxiety in young people: a call to action, The Lancet Planetary Health, 4, 10, pp. e435-e436, (2020); Seritan, Andreea L., Competency-Based Climate Change and Mental Health Education: An Emerging Paradigm, Academic Psychiatry, 49, 1, pp. 89-93, (2025); Cureus, (2025); Alowais, Shuroug A., Revolutionizing healthcare: the role of artificial intelligence in clinical practice, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023); Maci, Stefania Maria, Climate Change as a Threat to Global Health.

Specifically, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children face the highest burden of ECC compared to other children. Oral health (OH) interventions using adapted Motivational Interviewing (MI) to educate AI/AN parents/caregivers have demonstrated some promise. This study assessed the feasibility and short-term impact of a culturally adapted MI intervention designed for AI/AN pregnant women and mothers with young children. Methods: We partnered with two tribal Community Advisory Boards who helped culturally tailor program materials including adapted MI sessions. Community Health Representatives (CHRs) from both tribes were trained in adapted MI and conducted the OH education sessions with eligible mothers. OH knowledge and attitude assessments were conducted before and after the adapted MI sessions. Results: CHRs were able to recruit participants and implement the intervention as intended. Following the adapted MI sessions, we observed increases in general OH knowledge and modest increases in ratings of the importance of oral hygiene, oral self-efficacy, and perceived benefits of engaging in recommended OH behavior. No post-MI changes were observed in perceived severity of, or susceptibility to, OH problems. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of developing and implementing a culturally tailored, MI-based OH intervention for AI/AN caregivers, resulting in improved OH knowledge and self-efficacy. Given no significant change in other outcome variables, suggests a need for longer-term follow-up and integration with additional preventive strategies (e.g., fluoride varnish). Future research should explore the effectiveness of MI-based approaches in reducing ECC incidence over time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN); Community Advisory Board (CAB); Community-engaged research; Cultural tailoring; Early childhood caries (ECC); Oral health (OH); Oral Health Education","American Indian; Article; attitude; caregiver; child health; coronavirus disease 2019; culturally adapted motivational interviewing; dental caries; dental health; early childhood intervention; educational status; ethnicity; face; feasibility study; female; follow up; geography; health behavior; health belief; health education; health promotion; human; human experiment; income; knowledge; language; marriage; motivational interviewing; mouth hygiene; oral health behavior; outcome assessment; pandemic; preliminary outcomes; prevalence; psychosocial assessment; psychosocial care; public health; questionnaire; race; self concept; sociodemographics; tribal identity; tribal language fluency","","","This study was funded by the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), U01DE028508.","Reference Manual of Pediatric Dentistry, (2020); Choi, Sung-eun, Analysis of Race and Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Factors, and Tooth Decay Among US Children, JAMA Network Open, 6, 6, (2023); Indian Health Service Data Brief, (2015); Albino, Judith E.N., Promising directions for caries prevention with American Indian and Alaska Native children, International Dental Journal, 60, 3 SUPPL. 2, pp. 216-222, (2010); Albino, Judith E.N., Preventing Childhood Caries: A Review of Recent Behavioral Research, Journal of Dental Research, 95, 1, pp. 35-42, (2016); Weinstein, Phillip, Motivating mothers to prevent caries: Confirming the beneficial effect of counseling, Journal of the American Dental Association, 137, 6, pp. 789-793, (2006); Jamieson, Lisa Marie, Dental Disease Outcomes Following a 2-Year Oral Health Promotion Program for Australian Aboriginal Children and Their Families: A 2-Arm Parallel, Single-blind, Randomised Controlled Trial, eClinicalMedicine, 1, pp. 43-50, (2018); Harrison, Rosamund L., Effectiveness of maternal counseling in reducing caries in cree children, Journal of Dental Research, 91, 11, pp. 1032-1037, (2012); Batliner, Terrence S., Randomized Trial of Motivational Interviewing to Prevent Early Childhood Caries in American Indian Children, JDR Clinical and Translational Research, 3, 4, pp. 366-375, (2018); Braun, Patricia A., A cluster-randomized, community-based, tribally delivered oral health promotion trial in Navajo Head Start Children, Journal of Dental Research, 95, 11, pp. 1237-1244, (2016)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","30050774","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016470397"

This study investigates South African residents’ willingness to trust AI in healthcare decisions, exploring the impact of socio-demographic factors such as age and religion on their preferences. Methods: Utilizing a cross-sectional online survey distributed via Facebook, we gathered data from 341 respondents across South Africa. The survey assessed participants’ preference for human versus AI doctors in serious health scenarios, alongside demographic information including age, gender, educational attainment, religion, and home language. Weighting adjustments were applied to align the sample with South Africa’s demographic proportions for home language and gender. Data were analysed to explore correlations between these demographics and preferences for AI in healthcare. Results: A significant majority (73.7% weighted) expressed a preference for a human doctor over an AI doctor. Notably, the importance of religion (p <.001) and specific age groups (p =.025) significantly influenced preferences. A significant proportion of respondents for whom religion was “not too important,” as well as those in the 40–49 age group, preferred an AI doctor. Conclusions: This study underscores the need for innovative governance models tailored to resource-constrained settings, where traditional human-in-the-loop requirements may not always be feasible. Future research should explore how socio-cultural factors and trust dynamics influence public attitudes toward AI in healthcare and investigate models that ensure safety and accountability while addressing practical limitations in healthcare delivery systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Healthcare; Public trust; Socio-demographic factors; South Africa","adult; aged; article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; female; gender; groups by age; health care delivery; human; male; patient care; physician; religion; social media; sociodemographics; South Africa; South African; trust; adolescent; decision making; ethics; middle aged; public opinion; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Opinion; Religion; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust; Young Adult","","","The HSRC/Facebook Ethics & Human Rights and AI in Africa grant.

This study investigates the presence of the Invulnerability Bias (IB), where workers perceive that AI will have a greater impact on others’ jobs than on their own, and Optimism Bias by Type of Impact (OBTI), where individuals perceive AI’s future impact on their own job as more positive than on others’. The study analyzes survey data collected from 201 participants, recruited through social media using convenience sampling. The data were analyzed using a combination of statistical and machine learning methods, including the Wilcoxon test, ordinary least squares regression, clustering, random forests, and decision trees. Results confirm a significant IB, but not OBTI; only 31.8% perceived AI’s future impact on their own job as more positive than on others’. Analysis shows that greater knowledge of AI correlates with lower IB, suggesting that familiarity with AI reduces the tendency to externalize perceived risk.

Using data from a global cross-sectional survey involving 4,596 students across 48 countries, we employed Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to address selection bias and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine mediating effects. Regression models were also applied to estimate the relationships between AI curricular and students’ knowledge about and attitudes towards AI. Results reveal that participation in AI curricula significantly enhances students’ knowledge about AI (β =.140, p <.001), equipping them with essential skills for AI-driven healthcare systems. However, it concurrently diminishes their enthusiasm for integrating AI into medical education (β = -.108, p <.001), reflecting potential concerns about ethical and professional implications. No significant effects were observed on students’ attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence application in medicine, the physician’s role, or AI-related ethical and legal conflicts. Heterogeneity analysis shows stronger positive effects on knowledge for veterinary students and those from developing countries, where AI education addresses critical resource gaps. Conversely, the negative effect on enthusiasm for AI teaching is more pronounced among students from developed countries, where advanced AI applications are more prevalent. SEM results reveal that preparedness for work with AI partially mediates the relationship between AI curricula and students' knowledge (β =.062, p <.001) and attitudes (β =.023, p <.001), adding theoretical depth to the findings. These results underscore the importance of balanced AI education to enhance knowledge while addressing concerns about its integration in education. This research has significant practical and theoretical implications, emphasizing the need for tailored AI curricula that align with students’ professional goals and regional educational contexts. The study offers pathways for optimizing AI literacy globally, bridging resource disparities, and preparing future healthcare professionals for AI-driven advancements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI curricular; Artificial intelligence; Coarsened exact matching; Medical students; Structural equation modeling","adult; artificial intelligence; cross-sectional study; curriculum; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; medical education; medical student; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Male; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","This research receive grant from the Ministry of Education of the People\u2019s Republic of China (22JJD880002).","Abbaoui, Wafae, Towards revolutionizing precision healthcare: A systematic literature review of artificial intelligence methods in precision medicine, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 46, (2024); Abid, Areeba, AI Education for Fourth-Year Medical Students: Two-Year Experience of a Web-Based, Self-Guided Curriculum and Mixed Methods Study, JMIR Medical Education, 10, 1, (2024); Ahmad, Muna N., Student perspectives on the integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare services, Digital Health, 9, (2023); J Med Surg Public Health, (2024); Alam, Faiza, Integrating AI in medical education: embracing ethical usage and critical understanding, Frontiers in Medicine, 10, (2023); Albadrani, Basima Abdulfatah, Artificial Intelligence in Veterinary Care: A Review of Applications for Animal Health, Egyptian Journal of Veterinary Science, 55, 6, pp. 1725-1736, (2024); Cureus, (2023); Alowais, Shuroug A., Revolutionizing healthcare: the role of artificial intelligence in clinical practice, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023); Alwadani, Fahad, Attitude and Understanding of Artificial Intelligence Among Saudi Medical Students: An Online Cross-Sectional Study, Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare, 17, pp. 1887-1899, (2024); Amoozadeh, Matin, Trust in Generative AI among Students: An exploratory study, 1, pp. 67-73, (2024)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","40713579","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011755093"

There is a lack of qualitative research on the actual experiences and coping mechanisms of young people aged 18 to 45 years undergoing MHD, and understanding how these patients cope with the multidimensional impact of MHD is crucial for developing effective support strategies. This study aimed to explore the physical, mental, and social health challenges faced by young MHD patients and examine the coping strategies they employ to manage these difficulties. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted through semi-structured interviews with nine MHD patients in a tertiary hospital located in a new first-tier city in China. The interview data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method with the aid of NVivo 14 (QSR International) software, and all patients’ information was anonymized to protect their privacy. Results: We found that the patients faced physical health problems such as fatigue, dizziness, and dry mouth as their treatments continued. In terms of mental health, depression, irritability, and low self-esteem were reported, as well as adverse reactions that also affected the patients’ mental well-being. The patients also experienced social adjustment problems, such as difficulties with role identity, barriers to employment, and reduced social participation. They reported using many coping strategies, including self-regulation and seeking outside help. Family and partner support also played an important role in the management of the patients’ psychological states. Conclusions: This study identified complex and interrelated physical, psychological, and social challenges faced by young MHD patients and explored the coping strategies employed by them to cope with these challenges. By revealing the dynamic interplay between these domains, the findings suggest the development of personalized, multidimensional interventions to improve patient quality of life. The study provides new insights into the real-life experiences of young MHD patients and provides practical recommendations for key stakeholders, including healthcare providers, family members, and policy makers.

This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to predicting and monitoring psychological health risks in pregnant women using advanced machine learning techniques. The study employs a systematic methodology including data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and model implementation. Data collection was conducted at Majidia Hospital, involving a diverse sample of 70,000 pregnant women recruited through antenatal clinics, online health platforms, community outreach programs, and telephone surveys using structured questionnaires. Participants were selected across all pregnancy trimesters to ensure a representative demographic, capturing variations in age, educational background, occupational status, and parity. A diverse set of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were evaluated alongside ensemble methods to achieve robust and reliable predictions. The experimental results demonstrate that the Random Forest model consistently outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 97.82% ± 0.03%, precision of 97.82% ± 0.03%, recall of 100.00% ± 0.00%, and an F1 score of 96.81% ± 0.02%. SVM and Decision Tree classifiers also showed strong performance, with accuracy scores of 93.79% ± 0.01% and 91.82% ± 0.03%, respectively. Furthermore, ensemble methods enhanced predictive performance, highlighting their ability to balance accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In regression tasks, the Random Forest Regressor achieved near-perfect predictions with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.5767 × 10−8 and an R2 score of 1.000, underscoring its superior predictive capabilities. Additionally, a custom loss function integrating Cross-Entropy Loss and an F1 Score Penalty was introduced to address class imbalance and enhance model performance. The training process, conducted over 10 epochs, demonstrated consistent loss reduction, with the lowest recorded loss at epoch 8 (2.4382), reflecting effective learning and parameter tuning. This study envisions the development of an intelligent, web-based tool aimed at revolutionizing psychological health assessment and support for pregnant women. This tool will not only provide early diagnosis and intervention but also recommend personalized yoga practices and natural remedies to improve maternal mental health and overall wellbeing. These findings highlight the potential of AI-driven innovations in enhancing maternal care through holistic and accessible technological solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI-driven psychological assessment; Anxiety and depression detection; Maternal mental health; Pregnancy risk prediction; Pregnancy-related psychological health","adult; Bayes theorem; female; human; machine learning; maternal welfare; mental health; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; psychology; support vector machine; yoga; young adult; Adult; Bayes Theorem; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Maternal Health; Mental Health; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Support Vector Machine; Yoga; Young Adult","","","The authors sincerely acknowledge the generous funding and support provided by Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Researchers Supporting Project (PNURSP2025R757).

This study examined the effects of proactive versus passive algorithmic ethics practices on patient responses across different healthcare engagement types (privacy-focused vs. utility-focused). Methods: We conducted a 2 × 2 online experiment with 513 participants in China. The experiment manipulated the healthcare provider’s algorithmic ethics approach (proactive vs. passive) and the healthcare engagement type (privacy-focused vs. utility-focused). Participants were randomly assigned to view a scenario describing a hospital’s AI diagnostic system, then completed measures of attitudes, trust, and intentions to use the AI-enabled service. Results: Proactive algorithmic ethics practices significantly increased positive attitudes, trust, and usage intentions compared to passive practices. The positive impact of proactive practices was stronger for privacy-focused healthcare (e.g., mental health services) compared to utility-focused services emphasizing care optimization. Conclusions: This study underscores the critical role of proactive, context-specific algorithmic ethics practices in cultivating patient trust and engagement with AI-enabled healthcare.

This study analyzed recent trends in AI/AN ALD mortality, given their increased incidence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and high burden of CLD. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER). Geographic, age and sex-based temporal mortality trends of ALD deaths were analyzed among the AI/AN population in the US from 1999 to 2020. Joinpoint regression analyses determined trends in ALD crude and age-adjusted mortality rates, identifying the annual percent change (APC) in each subgroup. Results: In 1999–2020, the overall age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) among AI/ANs increased significantly from 27.2/100,000 to 88.4/100,000. Although men had a higher mortality rate overall, women had a higher increase in APC (2003–2008 APC was 17.7 [95% Cl: 9.9–26.0] and 2018–2020 APC was 25.3 [95% Cl: 11.4–40.9]) compared to men (1999–2020 APC was 5.8 [95% Cl 4.8–6.8]). All age groups studied witnessed an increase in AAMR. However, the age group 45–64 had the highest mortality overall in the preceding 2 decades. Non-metropolitan geographic regions had the highest mortality rate (2018–2020 APC of 25.5 [95% Cl: 5.0–50.0]) compared to medium/small or large metro areas. Western and Midwestern US Census regions had the highest mortality rates. Conclusions: Male sex, age 44–65, and rural dwelling was associated with a greater ALD AAMR in AI/AN populations. Social changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic may have led to increased ALD mortality. Discerning the underlying causality of these associations and examining the impact of the social determinants of health, may represent important opportunities to enhance care for AI/ANs as a vulnerable minority population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age adjusted mortality rate; Alcohol-associated liver disease; Alcoholism; American Indians and Alaskan Natives; Chronic liver disease; Health disparities","adolescent; adult; aged; Alaska Native; alcohol liver disease; American Indian; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; ethnology; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alaska Natives; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Young Adult","","","","Wang, Yichen, Global Burden of Digestive Diseases: A Systematic Analysis of the Global Burden of Diseases Study, 1990 to 2019, Gastroenterology, 165, 3, pp. 773-783.e15, (2023); Kulkarni, Neeti S., Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease Mortality Rates by Race before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the US, JAMA Health Forum, 4, 4, (2023); Younossi, Zobair M., The Global Burden of Liver Disease, Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, 21, 8, pp. 1978-1991, (2023); Banini, Bubu A., US mortality trends from alcohol-associated hepatitis by sex, age, race, and ethnicity, 1999–2020, Alcohol, Clinical and Experimental Research, 49, 2, pp. 358-367, (2025); White, Aaron M., Alcohol-Related Deaths during the COVID-19 Pandemic, JAMA, 327, 17, pp. 1704-1706, (2022); Vital Statistics Rapid Release, (2021); Wide Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Database National Vital Statistics System Mortality 1999 2020 on Cdc Wonder Online Database; Murphy, Sherry L., Deaths: Final Data for 2018, National Vital Statistics Reports, 69, 13, pp. 1-83, (2021); Nchs Urban Rural Classification Scheme for Counties, (2025); Subpart A of 45 Cfr Part 46 Basic Hhs Policy for Protection of Human Subjects, (2019)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14712458","","","40457328","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007084230"

However, the acceptance and intention of ordinary users to adopt AI health assistants require further exploration. This study aims to identify factors influencing users’ intentions to use AI health assistants and enhance understanding of the acceptance mechanisms for this technology. Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), we expanded the variables of perceived trust (PT) and perceived risk (PR). We recruited 373 Chinese ordinary users online and analyzed the data using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The results indicate that the original UTAUT structure is robust, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), and social influence (SI) significantly positively affect behavioral intention (BI), while facilitating conditions (FC) do not show a significant impact. Additionally, perceived trust is closely related to performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and behavioral intention, negatively impacting perceived risk. Conversely, perceived risk adversely affects behavioral intention.

While research has identified numerous risk factors, the specific impact of parental dysfunction on adolescent suicide remains understudied, especially in Chinese contexts. This study explores how parental dysfunction manifests in suicide notes and affects adolescent mental health. We collected data from Chinese social media platforms using web crawlers, yielding 30 valid suicide notes for analysis. Using the AI-aided content analysis platform DiVoMiner®, we conducted high-frequency word and semantic network analyses. Our findings reveal that parents are a central concern for suicidal youth. We identified three primary patterns of parental dysfunction: excessive emphasis on instrumental goals, neglect of basic emotional needs, and inadequate protection from life traumas. These dysfunctions contribute to severe psychological distress, identity loss, and negative coping behaviors among youth. The research highlights two significant phenomena in contemporary Chinese family dynamics: the ""short-sightedness"" of prioritizing short-term instrumental goals over long-term social-emotional development, and the remarkably high prevalence of ""lack of autonomy"" in parenting approaches. Our study extends the literature by exploring mechanisms through which parental dysfunctions contribute to suicidal behaviors in young people. These findings emphasize the need for collaborative efforts among parents, educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals to foster nurturing environments characterized by emotional support, autonomy encouragement, and balanced academic expectations—all crucial for adolescent well-being. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent mental health; Adolescent suicide; AI-aided content analysis; Parental dysfunctions; Suicide notes","adolescence; adolescent; Article; artificial intelligence-assisted analysis; child parent relation; China; clinical article; content analysis; coping; emotional development; emotional neglect; family attitude; female; goal attainment; human; identity; male; mental health; mental stress; parental behavior; parental dysfunction; personal autonomy; risk factor; semantics; social media; suicide; suicide note; written communication","","","This study was funded by the Macao Foundation (reference number: 028/DGAF/2023-02).","Suicide Key Facts, (2025); Sawyer, Susan Margaret, The age of adolescence, The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, 2, 3, pp. 223-228, (2018); Lim, Kim San, Global lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal behavior, deliberate self-harm and non-suicidal self-injury in children and adolescents between 1989 and 2018: A meta-analysis, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 22, (2019); Freuchen, Anne, Suicide notes written by child and adolescent suicide victims: A qualitative textual analysis, Scandinavian Psychologist, 5, (2018); Ligier, Fabienne, A Quantitative and Qualitative Study of Notes Left by Youth Who Died by Suicide in Quebec from 1895 to 1985, Archives of Suicide Research, 24, 4, pp. 554-567, (2020); Grøholt, Berit, Suicide among children and younger and older adolescents in Norway: A comparative study, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 37, 5, pp. 473-481, (1998); Haines, Janet, The characteristics of those who do and do not leave suicide notes: Is the method of residuals valid?, Omega: Journal of Death and Dying, 63, 1, pp. 79-94, (2011); Mathew, Anju, Exploring the Family factors associated with Suicide Attempts among Adolescents and Young Adults: A Qualitative Study, Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, 43, 2, pp. 113-118, (2021); Handelman, Lori D., The content of suicide notes from attempters and completers, Crisis, 28, 2, pp. 102-104, (2007); Teixeira, Andreia Sofia, Revealing semantic and emotional structure of suicide notes with cognitive network science, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","1744859X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005796400"

Understanding students’ experiences is essential to enhancing AI literacy, adapting education to GAI, and implementing GAI technology. Therefore, the aim was to explore physiotherapy students’ experiences of and thoughts on GAI in their education, and its potential implications for their future careers in healthcare. Methods: Qualitative descriptive design. Focus groups were conducted, using a semi-structured interview guide, at the Physiotherapy program at Linköping University, Sweden, from March to April 2024. The 15 students were organized into three focus groups, one for each education year. The data was analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: An overarching theme “GAI—Great potential if navigating the challenges” emerged from three categories: 1) “Areas of GAI use in the learning process”: Students viewed GAI as a tool for introduction and inspiration, assimilating course content and enhancing clinical reasoning and problem-solving; 2) “Optimizing GAI use in education”: Students found GAI to be timesaving, tailored, and as a virtual study partner and teacher. They discussed the pros and cons of learning, concerns on permitted GAI usage, the need for a critical approach, and how individual experiences and interests influenced their interactions with GAI; 3) “Future with GAI in education and profession”: Students believed future GAI would be more reliable, use subject-specific GAI models and enhance health care delivery, but also pose risks related to profit motives and knowledge gaps. Conclusion: Physiotherapy students found GAI beneficial for learning and clinical reasoning but expressed concerns about its impact on learning quality. They emphasized the importance of a critical approach when using GAI and the need for organizational support, including supporting permitted GAI use. Students believed that future advanced GAI models could provide accurate and reliable educational tools and healthcare tools supporting documentation and evidence-based decision-making. However, potential risks include business profit motives and knowledge gaps. Navigating these challenges is essential to fully leveraging GAI’s benefits in education and physiotherapy practice.

Despite growing interest, physiotherapy students’ perspectives remain unexplored. This study investigated Italian physiotherapy students’ knowledge, use, and perception of the benefits and limitations of AI Chatbots. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through Survey Monkey from February to June 2024. One thousand five hundred and thirty-one physiotherapy students from 10 universities were involved. The survey consisted of 23 questions investigating: (a) respondent characteristics, (b) AI Chatbot knowledge and use, (c) perceived benefits, and (d) limitations. Multiple-choice and Likert-scale-based questions were adopted. Factors associated with knowledge, use, and perceptions of AI were explored using logistic regression models. Results: Of 589 students (38%) that completed the survey, most were male (n = 317; 53.8%) with a mean age of 22 years (SD = 3.88). Nearly all (n = 561; 95.3%) had heard of AI Chatbots, but 53.7% (n = 316) never used these tools for academic purposes. Among users, learning support was the most common purpose (n = 187; 31.8%), while only 9.9% (n = 58) declared Chatbot use during internships. Students agreed that Chatbots have limitations in performing complex tasks and may generate inaccurate results (median = 3 out of 4). However, they neither agreed nor disagreed about Chatbots’ impact on academic performance, emotional intelligence, bias, and fairness (median = 2 out of 4). The students agreed to identify the risk of misinformation as a primary barrier (median = 3 out of 4). In contrast, they neither agreed nor disagreed on content validity, plagiarism, privacy, and impacts on critical thinking and creativity (median = 2 out of 4). Young students had 11% more odds of being familiar with Chatbots than older students (OR = 0.89; 95%CI 0.84–0.95; p = < 0.01), whereas female students had 39% lesser odds than males to have used Chatbots for academic purposes (OR = 0.61; 95%CI 0.44–0.85; p = < 0.01). Conclusions: While most students recognize the potential of AI Chatbots, they express caution about their use in academia. Targeted training for students and faculty, supported by institutional and national guidelines, could guarantee a responsible integration of these technologies into physiotherapy education.

Billions of people worldwide use social media and spend an average of 2.2 h a day on these platforms. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) applications have become widespread in many fields, such as health, education, and finance. While AI has the potential to monitor eating behaviors and provide personalized health support, excessive use of social media and AI can lead to negative effects. These include addiction and reduced quality of life. It is important to examine the attitude toward AI and its relationship with social media addiction, eating behavior, and life satisfaction. Research on the connection between AI attitudes and eating habits is lacking, which emphasizes the necessity of validating AIAS-4 in Turkish in order to ensure its efficacy in this context. The first stage of the study aimed to adapt Grassini’s (2023) Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale (AIAS-4) into Turkish and assess its validity and reliability. In the second stage, it was aimed to examine the relationship between artificial intelligence attitude and social media addiction, eating behavior, and life satisfaction. Methods: This study cross-sectional and methodological study was conducted in two stages in Türkiye. 172 adult individuals underwent a validity and reliability study in the first stage (43% of them were men and 57% were women), which involved adapting the AIAS-4 into Turkish. In the second stage, the relationships between artificial intelligence attitude, social media addiction, eating behavior, and life satisfaction of 510 individuals were evaluated with an average age of 24.88 ± 7.05 years (30.8% male, 69.2% female). Using the snowball sampling technique, the survey was carried out on adults by reaching out to staff and their families from both universities (Gazi University and Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University) as well as students and their relatives. A face-to-face survey approach (delivered by an interviewer) was used for the study. In this study, the Social Media Addiction Scale-Adult Form(SMAS-AF) was used to assess social media addiction, the Scale of Effects of Social Media on Eating Behavior (SESMEB) was used to measure the impact of social media on eating behavior, the Contentment with Life Assessment Scale was used to evaluate life satisfaction, and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q total) was used to assess eating disorder symptoms. Pearson Correlation and Spearman Correlation according to normality and Linear regression analysis were used to analyse variables. Results: AIAS-4 was a valid and reliable instrument in this study conducted in Türkiye (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90 and McDonald’s omega = 0.89). Individuals spend an average of 3.7 ± 1.99 h per day on social media. All participants used WhatsApp, while 89.8% used Instagram. A negative correlation was found between AIAS and EDE-Q total, (r=-0.119 p < 0.05). BMI correlated positively with EDE-Q total (r = 0.391, p < 0.01). Higher AIAS scores were associated with increased time spent on social media (r = 0.129, p < 0.001). Conversely, higher AIAS scores were associated with lower EDE-Q total scores (r= -0.119, p < 0.001). SESMEB correlated positively with EDE-Q total (r = 0.169; p < 0.001). The model showed that BMI (β = 0.311; p < 0.001), AIAS (β =-0.157, p = 0.005), SMAS-AF (β = 0.036; p = 0.002) and SESMEB (β = 0.022; p = 0.038) affected EDE-Q total (p < 0.001 R2 = 0.198). Conclusion: This study revealed that the Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale (AIAS) is valid and reliable for Turkish adults. The results show that BMI, social media addiction have positive, and AI attitude has negative impact on eating behaviors. These findings emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary approaches and awareness programs in the prevention and management of eating disorders. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence attitude; BMI; Eating behavior; Eating disorder; Social media addiction","addiction; adult; artificial intelligence; cross-sectional study; feeding behavior; female; human; male; middle aged; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; satisfaction; social media; turkey (bird); validation study; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Behavior, Addictive; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey; Young Adult","","","","Shanmugasundaram, Mathura, The impact of digital technology, social media, and artificial intelligence on cognitive functions: a review, Frontiers in Cognition, 2, (2023); Makridakis, S.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising opportunity to enhance both the accuracy of screening and the efficiency of ongoing care management, assisting healthcare providers in mitigating the incidence and complications of DR. Methods: Systematic review of the literature was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Searches were performed using PubMed-Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases, with the protocol registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) database: (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TJ9UH). A predefined search strategy utilizing Boolean operators was applied, and two researchers independently selected articles, with a third resolving any discrepancies. Results: Of the 2127 articles identified, 8 studies were included. The results highlighted that AI is particularly effective in enhancing the DR screening process in patients with T1D, offering rapid and reliable analysis. Healthcare providers reported positive feedback, noting its significant contribution to improving patient management. Conclusions: The integration of AI into DR care pathways shows substantial potential for improving early diagnosis and disease management, particularly for patients with T1D. Further research is required to optimize AI implementation and ensure its positive and sustainable impact on public health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Diabetic retinopathy screening; Health technology assessment; Public health; Type 1 diabetes","hemoglobin A1c; adolescent; adult; area under the curve; artificial intelligence; biomedical technology assessment; continuous glucose monitoring; data base; data extraction; deep learning; diabetic complication; diabetic macular edema; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic accuracy; female; follow up; health care personnel; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; medical specialist; multicenter study (topic); ophthalmologist; ophthalmology; patient care; positive feedback; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; primary medical care; proliferative retinopathy; prospective study; quality control; random forest; randomized controlled trial (topic); receiver operating characteristic; retina image; Review; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; systematic review; young adult; complication; diagnosis; early diagnosis; epidemiology; etiology; mass screening; procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetic Retinopathy; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Mass Screening","","hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6","","Non Communicable Diseases, (2024); Guidance on Global Monitoring for Diabetes Prevention and Control Framework Indicators and Application, (2025); Cangelosi, Giovanni, Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) and Lifestyle Medicine (LM) for support and care of patients with type II diabetes in the COVID-19 era: a cross-observational study, Acta Biomedica, 94, S3, (2023); Li, Yongze, Prevalence of diabetes recorded in mainland China using 2018 diagnostic criteria from the American Diabetes Association: National cross sectional study, BMJ, 369, (2020); Kolarić, Vilma, CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES AND QUALITY OF LIFE, Acta Clinica Croatica, 61, 3, pp. 520-527, (2022); Friel, Kathleen Michelle, Estimating and examining the costs of inpatient diabetes care in an Irish Public Hospital, Diabetic Medicine, 39, 4, (2022); Idf Diabetes Atlas 2021 Idf Diabetes Atlas; Ikegami, Hiroshi, Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults: Current status and future prospects, Geriatrics and Gerontology International, 22, 8, pp. 549-553, (2022); undefined; Diabetic Retinopathy, (2023)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","1873460X; 10568727","","JDICE","40763585","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012259938"

Very unequally distributed across the country and depending on the specialty, this shortage is linked to four phenomena: a still insufficient number of graduated specialists given the needs of an aging population and medical demographics; an organization of care largely based on supply rather than on a population-based approach; a distribution across territories that is insufficiently adapted to local health realities; and insufficient consideration of attractiveness factors, with a particularly worrying impact on private practice. The working group heard from many stakeholders, bringing them together in workshops focused on the main difficulties encountered. It focused its questions on practical measures that could improve the current situation. Recommendations were thus developed on: (1) planning training needs and their organization by developing a territorial university approach for theoretical teaching and internships, (2) Organizing care and the changes to be made by facilitating the decompartmentalization of the healthcare system and easing practice conditions while considering new technologies, particularly AI, (3) considering regional planning issues by integrating the role of local authorities and the territory at the local and regional levels, in coordination with the state (ARS), (4) developing factors of territorial attractiveness by encouraging young specialists to choose to set up locally, (5) Given the complexity and diversity of local situations, a practical improvement in the observed shortages can only be achieved through integrated regional management adapted to the situation at hand.; La pénurie en médecins spécialistes est une réalité vécue au quotidien très négativement par les Français. Très inégalement répartie sur le territoire national, et fonction des spécialités, cette pénurie est en relation avec quatre phénomènes: un nombre encore insuffisant de spécialistes formés, eu égard aux besoins d'une population vieillissante et à la démographie médicale, une organisation des soins largement fondée sur l'offre et non sur une approche populationnelle, une répartition dans les territoires très déséquilibrée et insuffisamment adaptée aux réalités sanitaires locales, une prise en compte insuffisante des facteurs d'attractivité avec un impact particulièrement préoccupant pour l'exercice libéral. Le groupe de travail a auditionné un nombre important de parties prenantes en les réunissant sous forme d'ateliers de travail consacrés aux principales difficultés rencontrées. Il a concentré ses interrogations sur les mesures pratiques qui pourraient améliorer la situation actuelle.

Understanding students' perceptions of AI and its impact on psychological factors, such as self-efficacy and psychological distress, is crucial for effective implementation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence nursing students' perceptions of AI, psychological distress, and self-efficacy. Design: A cross-sectional study design was used. Participants and setting: This study was conducted using a convenience sample of 108 nursing students from a public university in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Three instruments were used: The Perceptions of AI, Kessler Psychological Distress, and Self-Efficacy scales. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and multiple linear regression. Results: The study found that participants who used AI displayed significant differences in their self-efficacy. Additionally, notable associations were found between perceptions of AI, self-efficacy, and psychological distress. However, while the regression models were significant, the perceptions of AI did not meaningfully explain the variance in these outcomes (p > 0.05). Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of addressing students' perceptions of AI to improve their educational experiences and mental well-being. Future research should explore the longitudinal impact of mental health interventions in technology-driven learning environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Education; Psychological distress; Self-efficacy; Students","adult; artificial intelligence; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; mental stress; nursing education; nursing student; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; Saudi Arabia; self concept; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Humans; Male; Self Efficacy; Stress, Psychological; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the Ongoing Research Funding program, (ORF-2025-438) at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Abuzaid, Mohamed Mahmoud, Integration of artificial intelligence into nursing practice, Health and Technology, 12, 6, pp. 1109-1115, (2022); Al-Abdullatif, Ahlam Mohammed, ChatGPT in Learning: Assessing Students’ Use Intentions through the Lens of Perceived Value and the Influence of AI Literacy, Behavioral Sciences, 14, 9, (2024); Saudi Med J, (2025); Cureus, (2020); Almansour, Ahmed Mansour, Self-esteem among nursing students at a public university in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study, Belitung Nursing Journal, 9, 4, pp. 377-383, (2023); Alqahtani, Friyal Mubarak, A phenomenological exploration of nurse educators' roles in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, Journal of Nursing Management, 30, 7, pp. 3102-3112, (2022); Mowanes Alruwaili, Majed Mowanes, Exploring nurses’ awareness and attitudes toward artificial intelligence: Implications for nursing practice, Digital Health, 10, (2024); Alsadaan, Nourah, Challenges facing the nursing profession in saudi arabia: An integrative review, Nursing Reports, 11, 2, pp. 395-403, (2021); Anand, Nitin, Internet use behaviors, internet addiction and psychological distress among medical college students: A multi centre study from South India, Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 37, pp. 71-77, (2018); Andrade, Chittaranjan, The Inconvenient Truth About Convenience and Purposive Samples, Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, 43, 1, pp. 86-88, (2021)","","Churchill Livingstone","","","","","","02606917; 15322793","","","40544672","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008444878"

To address this, four workshops were held during the 28th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai. These workshops gathered insights into the experiences of urban children and youth in cities affected by climate change through discussions with youth and other stakeholders present at COP28. Opportunities for creating healthier and more sustainable youth-focused cities were identified using a participatory approach. Youth facilitators led discussions between participants and an expert panel, and participants shared their experiences and perspectives of growing up in cities and their hopes for future youth-focused cities amidst a changing climate. Narrative was collected through an online collaboration tool, which was fed into an artificial intelligence tool to generate images, which served as triggers for further discussion. The thematic analysis of the narratives was conducted by a team of early-career researchers. Three themes were identified: the effects of climate change on urban youth, visions for healthier and more sustainable cities prioritising youth, and principles guiding action. The findings emphasize the importance of involving young people and representing children's needs in research and decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; Climate; Health; Sustainability; Urban; Youth","artificial intelligence; climate change; participatory approach; sustainability; urban planning; Dubai [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates","","","The authors have submitted a detailed disclosure of interests form for this research.

We used hierarchical Bayesian regression models to assess the impact varying information presentation styles on effectiveness, trustworthiness, and usability. The findings revealed perceptions of low usability significantly decreased the effectiveness of the healthcare chatbot.

While stepwise methods are traditionally employed for covariate identification, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches offer promising alternatives for enhancing these analyses. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the application of AI/ML and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for drug clearance prediction and covariate analysis using two distinct datasets for the drugs methotrexate and remifentanil. For the larger methotrexate dataset, we utilized multiple ML models including convolutional neural networks, logistic regression, and gradient boosting and highlighted exceptional performance (R2 for accuracy > 0.96) in clearance prediction. XAI via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is utilized to identify vital covariates impacting clearance. Here, XAI techniques are utilized to explore how different AI/ML approaches might impact the interpretation of relationships among covariates. By examining these methods, we seek to better understand their respective strengths, limitations, and potential to provide insights for popPK analysis. The second example used a smaller dataset for the drug remifentanil and included pediatric to adult populations. Here, the performance of the ML models was more modest (maximum R2 of 0.75), highlighting the dependence of ML techniques on adequate sample sizes. SHAP analysis confirmed age and weight as critical covariates for the clearance of remifentanil. Our findings demonstrate that AI/ML approaches can provide accurate clearance predictions and identify potentially overlooked covariates in an unbiased, hypothesis-free manner. However, this study also emphasizes important limitations, including the requirement for sufficiently large datasets and the drug-specific nature of trained models. These proof-of-concept examples illustrate how AI/ML methods can complement traditional pharmacokinetic analyses, offering additional insights while maintaining scientific rigor. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","methotrexate; remifentanil; Article; artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; correlation coefficient; cross validation; deep learning; drug clearance; health care utilization; human; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; machine learning algorithm; measurement accuracy; pharmacokinetics; prediction; predictive model; proof of concept; random forest; root mean squared error; Shapley additive explanation; training; adolescent; adult; biological model; child; female; male; metabolic clearance rate; middle aged; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Methotrexate; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Proof of Concept Study; Remifentanil; Young Adult","","methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5, 7532-09-4, 6745-93-3, 51865-79-3, 60388-53-6; remifentanil, 132539-07-2, 132875-61-7; Methotrexate; Remifentanil","Funding: This research was supported by funds from the Hemostasis Branch/Division of Plasma Protein Therapeutics/Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies/Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in part by appointment to the Research Participation Program at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.","Population Pharmacokinetics Guidance for Industry, (2022); Agema, Bram C., Selecting the Best Pharmacokinetic Models for a Priori Model-Informed Precision Dosing with Model Ensembling, Clinical Pharmacokinetics, 63, 10, pp. 1449-1461, (2024); Asiimwe, Innocent Gerald, Machine-Learning Assisted Screening of Correlated Covariates: Application to Clinical Data of Desipramine, AAPS Journal, 26, 4, (2024); Sibieude, Emeric, Fast screening of covariates in population models empowered by machine learning, Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics, 48, 4, pp. 597-609, (2021); IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, (2021); Gunning, David, DARPA's explainable artificial intelligence program, AI Magazine, 40, 2, pp. 44-58, (2019); Lundberg, Scott M., A unified approach to interpreting model predictions, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017-December, pp. 4766-4775, (2017); A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions; An Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning Model for Warfarin Maintenance Dosing Using Policy Distillation and Action Forging; Terranova, Nadia, Artificial Intelligence for Quantitative Modeling in Drug Discovery and Development: An Innovation and Quality Consortium Perspective on Use Cases and Best Practices, Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 115, 4, pp. 658-672, (2024)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17528062; 17528054","9780123736390","","40968579","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016593798"

Negi and Forbush's recent pilot study introduces “Help for Overcoming Problem Eating” (HOPE), a D-SSI targeting binge-spectrum eating disorders in university students. Their findings suggest preliminary acceptability, feasibility, and symptom improvements, contributing to the growing evidence-base for D-SSIs in disordered eating. This commentary outlines five key challenges that must be addressed to translate pilot findings into real-world impact. First, the uptake of D-SSIs is often low, likely due to help-seeking barriers and septicism towards this approach. Peer-led, promotional campaigns may boost engagement of D-SSIs in young people. Second, despite their brevity, D-SSI completion is not assured. Strategies such as automated reminders, peer or AI-guided support, and youth co-design may improve adherence. Third, economic evaluations are rare but critical for determining whether D-SSIs offer cost-effective support within resource-limited student services. Fourth, trials should examine mechanisms and durability of change, with complementary D-SSIs offering promising directions. Finally, meaningful integration into care pathways is critical. D-SSIs may serve as stand-alone supports, early engagement tools, or components of stepped-care models. Lack of response could signal the need for intensive care, while successful use may increase openness to further help-seeking. Addressing these challenges with informative, implementation-ready trials will be key to realizing the full potential of D-SSIs in addressing eating disorders in university students and advancing youth mental health care more broadly. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital; eating disorders; mental health services; students","bridging therapy; eating disorder; economic evaluation; human; mental health; Note; university student; adolescent; pilot study; student; therapy; young adult; Adolescent; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Pilot Projects; Students; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (MRF1197249).

In 2021, the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu, India, implemented an artificial intelligence (AI)-based application aimed at expediting data verification to reduce delays and improve transparency in organ procurement. This retrospective observational study evaluated the effect of this intervention and identified key factors contributing to delays. Methods Data were collected from organ donors declared dead by neurological criteria (DND) between January 2018 and December 2023. Donors were categorised into two groups: pre-AI implementation (P1) and post-AI implementation (P2). Factors leading to delay were classified into four domains: family-related, physician-related, institution-related and government-related domains. A fishbone analysis was used to identify root causes. Results A total of 45 DND cases were analysed. The median time from the first apnoea test to organ procurement was 1657 (IQR, 1499–1899) min. A statistically significant increase in the retrieval time was observed at P2: 1587 (IQR, 1328–1779) min at P1 vs 1660 min (IQR, 1556–1959) at P2 (p=0.04). This increase was primarily driven by longer delays in transferring patients to the operating room after legal verification, which rose from 125 (IQR, 96–231) to 384 (IQR, 186–457) min (p=0.002). Conclusion This study underscores critical factors affecting organ retrieval timelines in a low-income to middle-income setting. While the AI-based protocol enhanced data verification and transparency, it also introduced unanticipated procedural delays. Ongoing evaluation and iterative refinement of AI tools are essential to optimise organ procurement efficiency and clinical outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Critical care; Quality improvement; Root cause analysis","adult; apnea; Article; artificial intelligence-assisted technology; brain dead donor; brainstorming; clinical pathway; clinical protocol; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; health care planning; human; intensivist; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neurosurgeon; observational study; organ donor; pandemic; retrospective study; root cause analysis; stakeholder participation; Tamil Nadu; tertiary care center; time interval; transplant coordinator; young adult","","","","Annadurai, Kalaivani, Road map to organ donation in Tamil Nadu: An excellent model for India, International Journal of Preventive Medicine, 2015-March, (2015); Hindu, (2022); Miller, Paul Elliott, Predictive Abilities of Machine Learning Techniques May Be Limited by Dataset Characteristics: Insights From the UNOS Database, Journal of Cardiac Failure, 25, 6, pp. 479-483, (2019); Olawade, David Bamidele, The impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning in organ retrieval and transplantation: A comprehensive review, Current Research in Translational Medicine, 73, 2, (2025); Hosseini, Seyed Amir Tabatabaei, New Tools for Data Harmonization and Their Potential Applications in Organ Transplantation, Transplantation, 108, 12, pp. 2306-2317, (2024); Theophilus Dhyankumar, C., Location of organ procurement and distribution organisation decisions and their impact on kidney allocations: a developing country perspective, Annals of Operations Research, 321, 1-2, pp. 755-781, (2023); Yu, Young-dong, Factors Delaying Organ Procurement After Declaration of Brain Death in Korea, Transplantation Proceedings, 48, 7, pp. 2403-2406, (2016); Med J Dr Dy Patil Vidyapeeth, (2024); Thyagarajan, Ishwarya, Organ donation and the medicolegal aspects: A process analysis study of the Indian States - Observational study, Indian Journal of Transplantation, 16, 2, pp. 184-188, (2022); Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management","","BMJ Publishing Group","","","","","","23996641","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014399883"

While previous reviews have largely focused on treatment modalities or structural determinants such as socioeconomic status and rurality, few studies have explored the role of social networks as risk or protective factors, particularly within AI/AN communities. Methods: Applying the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, the review synthesized findings from three scholarly databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, ProQuest), six institutional repositories (e.g., Indigenous Studies Portal), and one academic search engine (Google Scholar). Studies that examined the influence of social network domains on opioid misuse in AI/AN populations in the United States, reported quantitative or qualitative data, and were published between 2010 and 2022 were included in this review. Study quality was assessed with the JBI Checklists for Analytical Cross Sectional Studies and Qualitative Research. Of the 817 articles initially identified, 7 met the inclusion criteria, with most studies focusing on AI/AN adolescents and young adults, a demographic shown to be especially susceptible to opioid misuse. Results: The review identified several social network domains that significantly affect opioid use patterns, including familial relationships, peer associations, community dynamics, educational influences, cultural traditions, social media engagement and the effect of historical and intergenerational trauma. These domains can function either as protective buffers or as contributing factors to opioid misuse. Conclusions: The findings underscore the necessity for future longitudinal research to elucidate the causal pathways between these social network factors and opioid behaviors, particularly concerning trauma and digital media exposure. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of culturally grounded, evidence-based prevention strategies that address the multifaceted social environments of AI/AN individuals. Such approaches are critical to fostering resilience and mitigating the opioid crisis within these historically marginalized populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alaska native; American Indian; opioid misuse; protective factors; risk factors; social network; social support","Alaska Native; American Indian; community dynamics; drug dependence; drug misuse; family relation; human; opioid use disorder; qualitative research; Review; risk factor; social determinants of health; social interaction; social media; social network; social status; social support; systematic review","","","","Expired and Expiring Authorizations of Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2022, (2022); Multiple Cause of Death 1999 2017 Request, (2017); Wilson, Nana O., Drug and opioid-involved overdose deaths - United States, 2017-2018, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 69, 11, pp. 290-297, (2020); undefined; Native American Post Colonial Psychology, (1995); Mental Health Care for Urban Indians Clinical Insights from Native Practitioners, (2006); Results from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Summary of National Findings, (2014); Mpofu, Elias, Trending the evidence on opioid use disorder (OUD) continuum of care among rural American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) tribes: A systematic scoping review, Addictive Behaviors, 114, (2021); Opioid Crisis and Recent Federal Policy Responses, (2022); Health Behavior and Health Education Theory Research and Practice, (2008)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22279032","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014332715"

Although it can improve accuracy and interrater reliability, it is not infallible and can produce erroneous diagnoses, hence the need for pathologists to always check predictions. This critical judgment is particularly important when algorithm errors could lead to high-impact negative clinical outcomes, such as missing an invasive carcinoma. However, the influence of AI tools on pathologists’ decision-making is not well explored. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a previously developed AI tool on the diagnostic accuracy and inter-rater reliability among pathologists, while assessing whether pathologists maintain independent judgment of AI predictions. Eight pathologists from different hospitals and with varying levels of experience, participated in the study. Each of them reviewed 115 slides of laryngeal biopsies, including benign epithelium, low-grade and high-grade dysplasia, and invasive squamous carcinomas. The study compared diagnostic outcomes with and without AI assistance. The reference labels were established by an expert’s double-blind review. Results show that assisted pathologists had a higher accuracy for high-grade dysplasia, invasive carcinoma and improved inter-rater reliability. However, cases of over-reliance on AI have been observed, resulting in the omission of correctly diagnosed invasive carcinomas during the unassisted examination. The false predictions on these carcinoma slides were labeled with a low confidence score, which was not considered by the less experienced pathologists, showing the risk that they would follow the AI prediction without enough critical judgment or expertise. Our study emphasizes the potential over-reliance of pathologists on AI models and the potential harmful consequences, even with the advancement of powerful algorithms. The integration of confidence scores and the education of pathologists to use this tool could help to optimize the safe integration of AI into pathology practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; diagnostic pathology; diagnostic test accuracy study; dysplasia; hospital; human; invasive carcinoma; laryngeal biopsy; major clinical study; pathologist; pathology; predictive value; sensitivity analysis; World Health Organization; algorithm; diagnostic error; education; observer variation; procedures; reproducibility; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Diagnostic Errors; Humans; Observer Variation; Pathologists; Pathology, Clinical; Reproducibility of Results","","","This work was supported by funding awarded to ML by a CIFRE PhD Fellowship founded by TRIBUN HEALTH, Paris, France and ANRT (CIFRE 2019/1905).

Methods: Cancer incidences from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and cancer deaths from the National Vital Statistics System were obtained. Population data came from Census Bureau postcensal vintage 2022 estimates. Age-standardized rates of incidence and mortality in 2020 were compared via rate ratios across three race definitions: two definitions compliant with the 1997 OMB standards, namely race-alone and race-alone-or-in-combination, and one compliant with the previous 1977 OMB standards, namely bridged-race. Results: The proportions of multiracial individuals in the incidence and death data were lower than those in the population data, with the degree varying by age, race, and geography. However, race definitions had minimal impact on rates for Whites, Blacks, and Asians. Race-alone-or-in-combination rates were lower for Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders (NHOPIs) compared to race-alone rates, which suggests an underrepresentation of multiracial NHOPI individuals in the incidence data. Race-alone and race-alone-or-in-combination yielded similar rates for American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) but were significantly lower than their bridged-race counterparts, which suggests a mismatch in how AI/AN was classified between the incidence and population data. Conclusions: Improving the representation of multiracial incidence is essential for addressing the unique needs in cancer prevention and care among subpopulations with large shares of multiracial individuals. This article is the first to demonstrate the usefulness of race-alone-or-in-combination categories in capturing cancer burdens for minority race groups. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards; bridged-race; cancer incidence rate; cancer mortality rate; Census; in-combination race; multiple race; race-alone; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)","adolescent; adult; aged; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; Asian; Black person; budget; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer registry; Caucasian; central nervous system; classification; environmental factor; genetic analysis; government employee; human; ICD-O-3; incidence; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; management; mortality; Native Hawaiian; Pacific Islander; people of mixed ancestry; public health service; race; spectrum; United States; vital statistics; ancestry group; epidemiology; ethnicity; ethnology; female; male; middle aged; neoplasm; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Racial Groups; SEER Program; Young Adult","","","We acknowledge the National Cancer Institute for the cancer incidence data, the National Center for Health Statistics for the mortality data, and the US Census Bureau for the vintage population data.

Methods and procedure: In this retrospectively study, the independent performance of six endoscopists was evaluated after they had undergone initial training using either CADe (group A) or conventional endoscopy (group B: without CADe). Quality indicators and detection rates of laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 6000 patients were included in the analysis. Groups were equal demographically and had similar cecal intubation rate. Withdrawal time (WT) was longer in the AI-trained group (mean difference 0.8 min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6–1.0). AI-trained group had also a significantly improved adenoma detection rate (ADR) by 5.3% (95% CI: 2.9–7.6%) and sessile lesion detection rate (SDR) by 5.4% (95% CI: 3.8–7.0%). AI-assisted training enhanced the detection of non-granular LSTs smaller than 20 mm by 0.2% (95% CI 0.1% to 0.4%) and was identified as a factor of high-quality performance in terms of ADR and SDR (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.14–1.42; OR 1.93, 95% CI: 1.10 to 3.37, respectively). Conclusions: Endoscopists trained in colonoscopy using AI exceeded the aspirational targets of the quality guidelines when those trained conventionally achieved minimum quality measures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adenoma detection rate (ADR); Artificial intelligence (AI); Computer-aided detection (CADe); Endoscopy training","laxative; adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; cohort analysis; colonoscopy; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; endoscopist; endoscopy; female; human; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; surgical training; adenoma; clinical competence; colorectal tumor; diagnosis; education; health care quality; middle aged; procedures; Adenoma; Adult; Aged; Clinical Competence; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Retrospective Studies","","","","Bray, Freddie Ian, Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, Ca-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 68, 6, pp. 394-424, (2018); Rex, Douglas Kevin, Colorectal Cancer Screening: Recommendations for Physicians and Patients From the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, Gastroenterology, 153, 1, pp. 307-323, (2017); Keswani, Rajesh N., AGA Clinical Practice Update on Strategies to Improve Quality of Screening and Surveillance Colonoscopy: Expert Review, Gastroenterology, 161, 2, pp. 701-711, (2021); Kaminski, Michal F., Performance measures for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy: a European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Quality Improvement Initiative, Endoscopy, 49, 4, pp. 378-397, (2017); Bisschops, Raf, Advanced imaging for detection and differentiation of colorectal neoplasia: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Guideline - Update 2019, Endoscopy, 51, 12, pp. 1155-1179, (2019); Kaminski, Michal F., Quality indicators for colonoscopy and the risk of interval cancer, New England Journal of Medicine, 362, 19, pp. 1795-1803, (2010); Corley, Douglas Allen, Adenoma detection rate and risk of colorectal cancer and death, New England Journal of Medicine, 370, 14, pp. 1298-1306, (2014); Kang, James Hong En, Systematic review with meta-analysis: the prevalence of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancers using the World Endoscopy Organization nomenclature, Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 54, 10, pp. 1232-1242, (2021); Anderson, Rebecca, Causes of Post-Colonoscopy Colorectal Cancers Based on World Endoscopy Organization System of Analysis, Gastroenterology, 158, 5, pp. 1287-1299.e2, (2020); Hassan, Cesare, Variability in adenoma detection rate in control groups of randomized colonoscopy trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 97, 2, pp. 212-225.e7, (2023)","","Springer","","","","","","14322218; 09302794","","","40588603","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009528854"

Study design: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to collect data on mental health literacy and its impact on AI/AN patients' trust and interactions with their mental health providers. Methods: A total of 563 AI/AN adult patients completed the survey, which was disseminated using snowball sampling. We assessed mental health literacy using a multi-component measure and performed linear regressions to examine its associations with key factors including socio-demographic characteristics, mental health care access, trusting in mental health providers/specialists, the frequency of using mental health services, trusting in mental health providers/specialists for general health information and for COVID-19 information, as well as their level of satisfaction with the services received from mental health providers/specialists. Results: We identified mental health literacy as a major factor associated with patient-mental health provider relationships among AI/AN patients. Patients reporting lower levels of mental health literacy were likely to report having no regular access to mental health care, lower levels of trust in mental health providers/specialists, less satisfaction with the services received from mental health providers/specialists, and less trust in mental health specialists for COVID-19 information. Conclusions: Mental health literacy is a key factor influencing the patient-mental health provider relationships among AI/AN patients.

Methods: A pre-post survey design was employed to assess students' demographics, prior AI experience, confidence levels, and perceived challenges before and after the intervention. Virtual patient interactions were developed using Convai.ai to simulate self-care scenarios, aiming to enhance students' communication skills. The intervention included structured AI-driven patient simulations, followed by reflective assessments to measure changes in student confidence and perceived challenges in patient interactions. Results: All students had similar AI usage capacity with the highest capacity to include AI personal use followed by academic use. The intervention led to an increase in confidence in AI tools among both native and non-native speakers, with non-native speakers showing a rise from 56.2 % to 76.5 % and native speakers from 52.2 % to 79 %. Qualitative findings found three key themes: positive user experience, practical skill development, and confidence building, with students appreciating the AI tool's role in improving communication. Challenges included robotic interactions and formulating the right questions. Conclusion: The study concludes that AI communication tools offer valuable opportunities for enhancing pharmacy students' communication skills. However, further research with larger, more diverse samples is recommended to improve the use of AI in pharmacy education and address existing challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI communication tools; Convai AI; PharmD hybrid; SCHOLAR-MACs; Self-care scenarios; Virtual patient","adult; Article; artificial intelligence; communication skill; customer experience; health survey; human; interpersonal communication; patient simulation; pharmacy education; pharmacy student; qualitative analysis; robotics; self care; student attitude; young adult; female; male; perception; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Communication; Education, Pharmacy; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Students, Pharmacy; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","Future Healthc J, (2021); Baniasadi, Tayebeh, Challenges and practical considerations in applying virtual reality in medical education and treatment, Oman Medical Journal, 35, 3, pp. 1-10, (2020); Winkler-Schwartz, Alexander, Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education: Best Practices Using Machine Learning to Assess Surgical Expertise in Virtual Reality Simulation, Journal of Surgical Education, 76, 6, pp. 1681-1690, (2019); Kelly, Síle, A scoping review: virtual patients for communication skills in medical undergraduates, BMC Medical Education, 22, 1, (2022); Song, Cuiping, Enhancing academic writing skills and motivation: assessing the efficacy of ChatGPT in AI-assisted language learning for EFL students, Frontiers in Psychology, 14, (2023); Wallman, Andy, Communications training in pharmacy education, 1995-2010, American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, 77, 2, (2013); Stamer, Tjorven, Artificial Intelligence Supporting the Training of Communication Skills in the Education of Health Care Professions: Scoping Review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, (2023); undefined, (2024); Strielkowski, Wadim, AI-driven adaptive learning for sustainable educational transformation, Sustainable Development, 33, 2, pp. 1921-1947, (2025); Braun, Virginia, Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","18771297; 18771300","","","40315678","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003933874"

Background: Family research is exploring the application of AI. However, there is a critical need for a review study that systematically examines the varied use of AI in applied family science to inform family practitioners and policymakers. Method: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in nine databases. Of the 10,022 studies identified, 21 met inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed journal article; published between 2014–2024; written in English; involved the use of AI in collecting data, analyzing data, or providing family-centered services; included families raising young children 0–5 years; and was quantitative in analysis. Results: Most studies focused on maternal and child health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. All studies identified were in the AI use domain of data analysis, with 76% of the studies having a focus on identifying the most important predictors. Random forest performed as the best machine learning model. Only one study directly mentioned the ethical use of AI. Conclusion: Overall, the applied family science evidence base that employs AI is limited in size and scope, with most studies using AI for data analysis purposes with limited ethical considerations. Implications: AI models in applied family science can inform family services and policies aimed at promoting family and child health. However, thoughtful consideration of AI ethics and fairness is needed to prevent the negative social impacts of AI on marginalized groups of families and their young children. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","applied family science; artificial intelligence; data analysis; data collection; ethical use of AI; families with young children; machine learning; maternal and child health; service provision","","","","","Ahn, Eunhye, Leveraging machine learning for effective child maltreatment prevention: A case study of home visiting service assessments, Child Abuse and Neglect, 151, (2024); Amrit, Chintan, Identifying child abuse through text mining and machine learning, Expert Systems with Applications, 88, pp. 402-418, (2017); Child Protection Australia 202021, (2022); Bail, Christopher Andrew, Can Generative AI improve social science?, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 121, 21, (2024); Bertini, Ayleen, Using Machine Learning to Predict Complications in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, 9, (2022); Bose, Eliezer L., Machine Learning Methods for Identifying Critical Data Elements in Nursing Documentation, Nursing Research, 68, 1, pp. 65-72, (2019); Chen, Yan, Generative AI in Medical Practice: In-Depth Exploration of Privacy and Security Challenges, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 26, 1, (2024); Chouldechova, Alexandra, A case study of algorithm-assisted decision making in child maltreatment hotline screening decisions, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 81, pp. 134-148, (2018); Conrey, Shannon C., Obesity and Prenatal Intention as Predictors of Meeting Breastfeeding Recommendations in an Urban Birth Cohort, Breastfeeding Medicine, 19, 2, pp. 98-108, (2024); Demsash, Addisalem Workie, Using best performance machine learning algorithm to predict child death before celebrating their fifth birthday, Informatics in Medicine Unlocked, 40, (2023)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","17413729; 01976664","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204583880"

Caring Text Messages (CTM) is an evidence-based intervention, developed by the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, modeled after the Caring Contacts (CC) intervention. CC has been shown to prevent suicide deaths, attempts, ideation, and hospitalizations in a variety of settings. Method. Three sets of CTM were developed by American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) teens, college students, and veterans (tailored for each audience), which were reviewed by psychologists familiar with the intervention. To enroll in the service, participants texted a keyword to a text message short code and received two text messages per week with hopeful and encouraging messages. A robust multimedia social marketing campaign was designed to promote the service for each audience. Results. By September 2023, 387 participants enrolled in the Youth CTM intervention, 141 enrolled in the College CTM, and 31 enrolled in the Veterans CTM. Post surveys show elevated levels of user satisfaction. Conclusions. CTM can be tailored to reach populations at higher risk of suicide, including AI/AN youth, college students, and veterans, and connect them to culturally responsive peer and crisis support services. Continued monitoring and evaluation can guide next steps for marketing and outreach and will be useful to determine its impact on those who enroll. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian; caring contacts; mobile health; suicide prevention; text message intervention","adolescent; adult; Alaska Native; American Indian; female; health promotion; human; male; procedures; psychology; social marketing; student; suicide prevention; text messaging; university; veteran; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alaska Natives; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Social Marketing; Students; Suicide Prevention; Text Messaging; Universities; Veterans; Young Adult","","","We are grateful to the many teens, young adults, and veterans who shared their caring messages, to support and uplift their peers; those who enrolled in the campaigns; and those who shared their views and perspectives in the post-survey.

Communication technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, can potentially offer support to those experiencing mental health challenges by providing companionship and support. Specifically, social AI can mimic human interaction, which may help alleviate loneliness and anxiety through person-centered messaging. Despite growing AI usage, there is limited research on the effectiveness of specific message types in this context. Thus, this study employed a 2 (person-centered message: high vs. low) × 2 (context: loneliness vs. anxiety) between-subjects design to test how different supportive messages from social AI chatbots impact subsequent outcomes. Results revealed that high person-centered messages are associated with increased emotional validation. Furthermore, the quality of social support and interpersonal warmth (IW) mediated the relationship between high person-centered messages and emotional validation. Finally, the mediation effect between high person-centered messages and emotional validation via the quality of emotional support was moderated by social presence, but not the mediation effect between high person-centered messages and emotional validation via IW. These results demonstrate the importance of developing social AI chatbots that employ messages high in person-centeredness, as these messages are most important for addressing mental health concerns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anxiety; artificial intelligence (AI); emotional validation; interpersonal warmth (IW); loneliness; person-centered messages; social support","adult; aged; anxiety; Article; artificial intelligence chatbot; comfort; conversation; data analysis; emotional support; female; gender identity; human; human relation; information processing; interpersonal communication; interpersonal warmth; loneliness; male; mental health; middle aged; mitigation; person centered message; pilot study; sampling; social connectedness; social support; wellbeing; young adult; artificial intelligence; generative artificial intelligence; psychology; social interaction; therapy; Adult; Anxiety; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Social Interaction; Social Support; Young Adult","","","This work was financially supported by the Charles Phelps Taft Research Center.","Loneliness in U S Subsides from Pandemic High, (2023); Anxiety Statistics and Facts, (2023); Latest Federal Data Show that Young People are More Likely than Older Adults to Be Experiencing Symptoms of Anxiety or Depression, (2023); Kim, Jihyun, AI as a friend or assistant: The mediating role of perceived usefulness in social AI vs. functional AI, Telematics and Informatics, 64, (2021); Ta, Vivian P., User experiences of social support from companion chatbots in everyday contexts: Thematic analysis, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22, 3, (2020); Meng, Jingbo, Emotional Support from AI Chatbots: Should a Supportive Partner Self-Disclose or Not?, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 26, 4, pp. 207-222, (2021); Westerman, David Keith, I-It, I-Thou, I-Robot: The Perceived Humanness of AI in Human-Machine Communication, Communication Studies, 71, 3, pp. 393-408, (2020); Merrill, Kelly Jr, AI companions for lonely individuals and the role of social presence, Communication Research Reports, 39, 2, pp. 93-103, (2022); Klos, Maria Carolina, Artificial intelligence⇓based chatbot for anxiety and depression in university students: Pilot randomized controlled trial, JMIR Formative Research, 5, 8, (2021); High, Andrew C., A Review and Meta-Analysis of Person-Centered Messages and Social Support Outcomes, Communication Studies, 63, 1, pp. 99-118, (2012)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","00778923; 17496632","9781573317504; 9781573317573; 9781573317382; 9781573316590; 9781573317672; 9781573316804; 1573316555; 9781573317399; 9781573317337; 1573316490","ANYAA","40572032","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009331993"

Attitudes toward innovation and artificial intelligence technologies will be crucial in determining their future impact on patient care. Therefore, assessing these attitudes early will be a significant step in shaping the future of nursing education. Design: A cross-sectional multicenter study and adhering to STROBE guidelines. Method: The study was performed at nursing schools of three universities, surveying a total of 269 first-year nursing students enrolled in 2024. A validated instrument, Innovation Skills Measurement Tool for Youth and the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale. Descriptive statistics, Student's t-test and One-Way ANOVA tests were used in the analyses. Results: Students demonstrated high innovation skills (121.51 (SD 23.42) and positive attitudes towards artificial intelligence (65.83 (SD 8.99). Innovation skills were significantly higher among those knowledgeable about healthcare innovation (125.63 (SD 23.20) and those following innovation-related applications (129.16 (SD 24.66). Positive AI attitudes were higher in those familiar with AI (67.31 (SD 8.83), those using AI-based applications (67.39 (SD 8.95) and those interested in developing innovative products (68.13 (SD 9.66) (p < 0.05). A moderate correlation was found between positive AI attitudes and innovation skills (r =.314). Conclusions: First-year nursing students generally have a positive attitude towards artificial intelligence; however, concerns remain regarding its use in daily practice. This suggests that specialized training programs focusing on both artificial intelligence applications and innovation skills could be beneficial for nursing students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Attitude; Innovation skills; Nursing; Students","adult; artificial intelligence; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; multicenter study; nursing education; nursing student; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Humans; Male; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Abou Hashish, Ebtsam Aly, Digital proficiency: assessing knowledge, attitudes, and skills in digital transformation, health literacy, and artificial intelligence among university nursing students, BMC Medical Education, 24, 1, (2024); Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Health Sciences, (2022); Technol Forecast Soc Change, (2022); Alkan, Seval Aǧaçdiken, Is artificial intelligence an opportunity or a threat in nursing care?: An in-depth phenomenological study, Archives of Psychiatric Nursing, 54, pp. 54-62, (2025); Kastamonu Education Journal, (2023); Altmiller, Gerry M., Influence of Technology in Supporting Quality and Safety in Nursing Education, Nursing Clinics of North America, 57, 4, pp. 551-562, (2022); Amiri, Hamidreza, Medical, dental, and nursing students’ attitudes and knowledge towards artificial intelligence: a systematic review and meta-analysis, BMC Medical Education, 24, 1, (2024); Ansari, Natasha, An online approach to teaching graduate nursing students to write integrative literature reviews: Examples from two published cases, Nurse Education in Practice, 82, (2025); Ashraf, Muhammad Azeem, Editorial: Impact of technology on human behaviors in medical professions education, Frontiers in Medicine, 12, (2025); Journal of Inonu University Health Services Vocational School, (2021)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","14715953; 18735223","","","40532276","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008190766"

The research finds a significant relationship between AI-integrated learning environments and students' emotional well-being, which in turn influences their levels of engagement. While AI systems provide personalized learning experiences and immediate feedback that can alleviate some emotional distress, they also have the potential to evoke negative emotions such as anxiety and frustration, particularly when students feel overwhelmed or unsupported. These emotional fluctuations directly affect student engagement, leading to difficulties in participation, motivation, and focus. Data from 673 university participants in North China were analyzed using SPSS (version 27) and AMOS (version 24) to apply various statistical methods, including correlation, regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results suggest that emotional health, particularly in terms of depression and anxiety, plays a pivotal role in student engagement in AI-enhanced environments. Students experiencing emotional distress tend to struggle with engagement, which adversely impacts academic performance. Conversely, those with better emotional health demonstrate improved engagement, highlighting the importance of addressing emotional well-being in AI-supported learning settings. This study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between emotional health and student engagement, offering implications for the design of more supportive and effective AI-based educational experiences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI-enhanced environments; Anxiety; Depression; Emotional health; Positive psychology; Students' engagement","adolescent; adult; anxiety; China; depression; emotion; female; human; male; mental health; psychology; student; university; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Students; Universities; Young Adult","","","The research received funding from Shanxi Provincial Education Department under Grant Agreement No. [J20230722].","Aktar, Evin, Pupillary Responses to Dynamic Negative Versus Positive Facial Expressions of Emotion in Children and Parents: Links to Depression and Anxiety, Developmental Psychobiology, 66, 6, (2024); Alam, Sohaib, Reflecting the voices of EFL teachers in the world of Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Assessment (ICALA): an insight into teacher immunity, reflective teaching, job satisfaction, and L2-teacher grit, Language Testing in Asia, 14, 1, (2024); Appiah, Richard, Effects of a Community-Based Multicomponent Positive Psychology Intervention on Mental Health of Rural Adults in Ghana, Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being, 12, 3, pp. 828-862, (2020); Dehbozorgi, Raziye, The application of artificial intelligence in the field of mental health: a systematic review, BMC Psychiatry, 25, 1, (2025); Derakhshan, Ali, EFL students’ perceptions about the role of generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-mediated instruction in their emotional engagement and goal orientation: A motivational climate theory (MCT) perspective in focus, Learning and Motivation, 90, (2025); Derakhshan, Ali, A self-determination perspective on the relationships between EFL learners’ foreign language peace of mind, foreign language enjoyment, psychological capital, and academic engagement, Learning and Motivation, 87, (2024); Derakhshan, Ali, The Interplay between Perceived Teacher Support, Self-regulation, and Psychological Well-being among EFL Students, Iranian Journal of Language Teaching Research, 12, 3, pp. 113-138, (2024); Derakhshan, Ali, Longitudinal exploration of interconnectedness through a cross-lagged panel design: enjoyment, anxiety, willingness to communicate, and L2 grit in english language learning, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 46, 8, pp. 2192-2210, (2025); Derakhshan, Ali, Is ChatGPT an evil or an angel for second language education and research?

Digital health applies digital transformation to the healthcare field, incorporating software, hardware and services. The usefulness of digital health technologies such as digital contact tracing apps (CTAs) depends deeply on the acceptance to use them. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study is to explore the usage of CTAs by integrating the protection motivation theory (PMT) and technology acceptance model (TAM) in the Jordanian context. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares structural equation modelling was employed to test empirically the integrated research model against data collected from 420 respondents, leading to the identification of the important determinants for the usage of CTAs. Findings: The results reveal that perceived severity and perceived vulnerability have a significant positive impact on the perceived need for CTAs, which, in turn, affects the individuals’ intention to use CTAs. It also reveals that perceived trust in government, perceived privacy and perceived usefulness have a significant positive impact on individuals’ intention to use CTAs, which, in turn, affects the usage of CTAs. In contrast, perceived ease of use did not find any significant relationship, and hence hypothesis H7 was not supported. Lastly, social media awareness has a significant positive impact on perceived usefulness and ease of use. Originality/value: This study is considered among the first studies in the Jordanian context that integrate the PMT and TAM to gain a better understanding of the critical determinants for the acceptance and usage of CTAs in the context of pandemics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contact tracing apps; COVID-19 pandemic; Digital health; Digital technologies; Exposure detection apps; Healthcare; Technology acceptance and adoption","adult; artificial intelligence; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; Jordan; male; middle aged; mobile application; procedures; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Contact Tracing; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Al-Okaily, Manaf, An empirical investigation on acceptance of mobile payment system services in Jordan: extending UTAUT2 model with security and privacy, International Journal of Business Information Systems, 42, 1, pp. 123-152, (2023); Peer to Peer Marketing of A Covid 19 Contact Tracing App, (2020); Adams-Prassl, Abi, Inequality in the impact of the coronavirus shock: Evidence from real time surveys, Journal of Public Economics, 189, (2020); Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi, The Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Development and Initial Validation, International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 20, 3, pp. 1537-1545, (2022); Al-Okaily, Manaf, Blockchain technology and its applications in digital accounting systems: insights from Jordanian context, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, (2023); Al-Okaily, Manaf, The influence of e-satisfaction on users' e-loyalty toward e-wallet payment apps: a mediated-moderated model, International Journal of Emerging Markets, 20, 6, pp. 2428-2454, (2025); Al-Okaily, Manaf, So What About the Post-COVID-19 Era?: Do Users Still Adopt FinTech Products?, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 41, 2, pp. 876-890, (2025); Al-Okaily, Manaf, Artificial intelligence and its applications in the context of accounting and disclosure, Journal of Financial Reporting and Accounting, 23, 4, pp. 1387-1401, (2025); Al-Okaily, Manaf, Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on continuance usage of electronic tax declaration platforms: extending classical UTAUT model, Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance, 26, 6, pp. 640-658, (2024); Al-Okaily, Manaf, Financial data modeling: an analysis of factors influencing big data analytics-driven financial decision quality, Journal of Modelling in Management, 20, 2, pp. 301-321, (2025)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","14777266","","","39632449","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211124260"

OASIS can lead to anal incontinence and dyspareunia, having important implications regarding the quality of life and health of women but, unfortunately, there is no standard practice for postpartum care following OASIS. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, patients diagnosed with OASIS between January 2016 and June 2023 were enrolled. Since 2016, all women with OASIS have been routinely referred for physiatric evaluation and pelvic floor rehabilitation. Validated questionnaires (Wexner score and Marinoff scale) were administered to enrolled women to assess anal incontinence and dyspareunia. Results: The study included 148 women, of whom 88 responded to the questionnaires. Participants were divided into two groups: those who underwent PFPT (N = 68) and those who declined it (N = 20). The mean follow-up period was 1447.35 days. The Wexner score was lower in the PFPT group compared to the no-PFPT group (p = 0.050). The Marinoff score did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.381). Conclusion: PFPT was shown to be effective in reducing AI symptoms in women with OASIS, improving quality of life and maintaining its effects in the long term, but without providing benefits for dyspareunia. Strengths of this study include the use of validated questionnaires, the long follow-up period, and the involvement of a specialized team of physiatrists and physiotherapists. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Incontinence; Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS); Pelvic floor rehabilitation; Postpartum care; Women’s health","adult; anus sphincter; Article; behavior therapy; body mass; childbirth; clinical outcome; dyspareunia; education; feces incontinence; female; follow up; human; laceration; major clinical study; marinoff dyspareunia scale; observational study; obstetric anal sphincter injury; outcome assessment; pelvic floor; pelvic floor muscle training; perineal disease; perineum; physiokinesitherapy; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; practice guideline; quality of life; questionnaire; retrospective study; scoring system; symptom; vaginal delivery; vagino perineal laceration; Wexner score; young adult; adverse event; anal canal; etiology; injury; labor complication; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; rehabilitation; treatment outcome; Adult; Anal Canal; Delivery, Obstetric; Dyspareunia; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Lacerations; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pelvic Floor; Perineum; Physical Therapy Modalities; Pregnancy; Quality of Life; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome","","","","Harvey, Marie Andrée, Obstetrical Anal Sphincter Injuries (OASIS): Prevention, Recognition, and Repair, Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada, 37, 12, pp. 1131-1148, (2015); Pergialiotis, Vasilios, Risk factors for severe perineal trauma during childbirth: An updated meta-analysis, European Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, 247, pp. 94-100, (2020); Eshkoli, Tamar, Is epidural analgesia an independent risk factor for OASIS?

During 2010–2012, Alaska Native adults had higher rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations compared to other adults in Alaska. We evaluated potentially preventable hospitalizations among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults in the United States during 2016–2021. Methods: We used hospital discharge data from the Indian Health Service National Patient Information Reporting System (NPIRS) to calculate and compare average annual age-adjusted rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations per 1000 AI/AN adults for two acute conditions (community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection) and four chronic conditions (diabetes, heart failure, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension). Results: Of 310,889 hospitalizations among AI/AN adults, 40,400 (13 %) were defined as potentially preventable for an annual rate of 7.6 per 1000 persons. Rates were stable during 2016–2019 (8.7 per 1000) but declined during 2020–2021 (5.9 per 1000), likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults and rural residents had significantly higher rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations across all six conditions assessed, with community-acquired pneumonia having the highest hospitalization rate among adults aged ≥65 years (5.2 per 1000). Conclusions: Targeted preventive care and appropriate outpatient management for AI/AN elders living in rural areas might help improve health and reduce medical costs through decreased hospitalizations. Vaccination against respiratory infections could have the greatest impact in reducing preventable hospitalizations among AI/AN adults. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian or Alaska Native; Healthcare disparities; Hospitalization; Indian health service; Quality of health care; United States","acute disease; adult; aged; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; asthma; chronic disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; female; health care facility; heart failure; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; human experiment; hypertension; ICD-10-CM; leg amputation; male; pneumonia; potentially preventable hospitalization; respiratory tract infection; rural population; urinary tract infection; vaccination; epidemiology; middle aged; public health service; United States; young adult; Adult; Aged; American Indian or Alaska Native; Chronic Disease; COVID-19; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia; United States Indian Health Service; Young Adult","","","","undefined, (2023); undefined, (2024); Becker, Nora V., Trends in Hospitalizations for Ambulatory Care-Sensitive Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic, JAMA Network Open, 5, 3, (2022); Bruce, Michael G., Lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations among American Indian/Alaska Native adults, Indian Health Service and Alaska Region, 1998–2014, International Journal of Infectious Diseases, 111, pp. 130-137, (2021); Brueggemann, Angela B., Changes in the incidence of invasive disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis during the COVID-19 pandemic in 26 countries and territories in the Invasive Respiratory Infection Surveillance Initiative: a prospective analysis of surveillance data, The Lancet Digital Health, 3, 6, pp. e360-e370, (2021); Bullock, Ann K., Prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in American Indian and Alaska Native adults, 2006-2017, BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care, 8, 1, (2020); Rural Urban Continuum Codes, (2025); Healthy People 2030, (2020); Gounder, Prabhu P., Potentially preventable hospitalizations for acute and chronic conditions in Alaska, 2010–2012, Preventive Medicine Reports, 4, pp. 614-621, (2016); Holman, Robert C., Increasing trend in the rate of infectious disease hospitalisations among Alaska Native people, International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 72, SUPPL.1, (2013)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10960260; 00917435","","PVTMA","40203952","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002242129"

Vocational college students face unique barriers to physical activity, including academic pressures, low motivation, and limited access to structured exercise programs. Mobile fitness applications, such as running apps, have emerged as digital health interventions to promote physical activity, but their long-term effectiveness in vocational education settings remains largely unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the Sports World Campus app on key fitness metrics among vocational college students over two years. A longitudinal observational study was conducted among 5,000 vocational college students, assessing fitness improvements through standardised body mass index (BMI) measures, vital capacity, endurance, flexibility, strength, explosive power, and speed. App engagement data, including running distance, session frequency, and leaderboard rankings, were analysed using paired t-tests, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression models to determine the relationship between digital engagement and fitness outcomes. The results indicate significant improvements in endurance (p < 0.001) and vital capacity (p < 0.001), with strong correlations between app engagement levels and aerobic fitness gains. However, BMI and muscular strength exhibited minimal changes, suggesting that running apps primarily enhance cardiovascular endurance but are insufficient for comprehensive fitness development. These findings highlight the need for hybrid digital fitness interventions integrating endurance, strength, and flexibility training. Future research should explore adaptive AI-driven coaching, gamified engagement strategies, and multimodal exercise programs to enhance the effectiveness of digital health interventions for vocational students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital fitness interventions; endurance training; longitudinal study; mobile fitness applications; sports technology; vocational college students","","","","The authors thank the Faculty of Education, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, for supporting this research.

Consequently, pediatric neuroscience research lags adult counterparts, particularly in rare disease and under-represented populations. The removal of face regions (image defacing) can mitigate this; however, existing defacing tools often fail with pediatric cases and diverse image types, leaving a critical gap in data accessibility. Given recent National Institutes of Health data sharing mandates, novel solutions are a critical need. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tool for automatic defacing of pediatric brain MRIs, deep learning methodologies (nnU-Net) were used by using a large, diverse multi-institutional data set of clinical radiology images. This included multiparametric MRIs (T1-weighted [T1W], T1W-contrast-enhanced, T2-weighted [T2W], T2W-FLAIR) with 976 total images from 208 patients with brain tumor (Children’s Brain Tumor Network, CBTN) and 36 clinical control patients (Scans with Limited Imaging Pathology, SLIP) ranging in age from 7 days to 21 years old. RESULTS: Face and ear removal accuracy for withheld testing data were the primary measure of model performance. Potential influences of defacing on downstream research usage were evaluated with standard image processing and AI-based pipelines. Group-level statistical trends were compared between original (nondefaced) and defaced images. Across image types, the model had high accuracy for removing face regions (mean accuracy, 98%; n¼98 subjects/392 images), with lower performance for removal of ears (73%). Analysis of global and regional brain measures (SLIP cohort) showed minimal differences between original and defaced outputs (mean r<inf>S</inf> ¼ 0.93, all P, .0001). AI-generated whole brain and tumor volumes (CBTN cohort) and temporalis muscle metrics (volume, cross-sectional area, centile scores; SLIP cohort) were not significantly affected by image defacing (all r<inf>S</inf> . 0.9, P, .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The defacing model demonstrates efficacy in removing facial regions across multiple MRI types and exhibits minimal impact on downstream research usage. A software package with the trained model is freely provided for wider use and further development (pediatric-auto-defacer; https://github.com/d3b-center/pediatric-auto-defacer-public). By offering a solution tailored to pediatric cases and multiple MRI sequences, this defacing tool will expedite research efforts and promote broader adoption of data sharing practices within the neuroscience community. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; age; Article; artificial intelligence; brain scintiscanning; brain tumor; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; child; cohort analysis; contrast enhancement; controlled study; deep learning; ear amputation (procedure); female; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; human; image processing; infant; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; neuroscience; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; temporalis muscle; tumor volume; anonymization; diagnostic imaging; information dissemination; newborn; preschool child; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Child, Preschool; Data Anonymization; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Information Dissemination; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuroimaging; Neurosciences; Young Adult","","","This project was supported in part from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI; grant number U2CHL156291/3U2CHL156291-02S1 to A.C.R.).","Chen, Richard J., Algorithmic fairness in artificial intelligence for medicine and healthcare, Nature Biomedical Engineering, 7, 6, pp. 719-742, (2023); Wilkinson, Mark Denis, Comment: The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship, Scientific Data, 3, (2016); Mueller, Susanne G., Ways toward an early diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Alzheimer's and Dementia, 1, 1, pp. 55-66, (2005); Prior, Fred W., TCIA: An information resource to enable open science, Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology - Proceedings, pp. 1282-1285, (2013); Aberle, Denise R., Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening, New England Journal of Medicine, 365, 5, pp. 395-409, (2011); Buda, Mateusz, A Data Set and Deep Learning Algorithm for the Detection of Masses and Architectural Distortions in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Images, JAMA Network Open, 4, 8, (2021); Schwarz, Christopher G., Identification of anonymous MRI research participants with face-recognition software, New England Journal of Medicine, 381, 17, (2019); Mazura, Jan C., Facial recognition software success rates for the identification of 3D surface reconstructed facial images: Implications for patient privacy and security, Journal of Digital Imaging, 25, 3, pp. 347-351, (2012); Abramian, David, Refacing: Reconstructing anonymized facial features using GANS, Proceedings - International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, 2019-April, pp. 1104-1108, (2019); Bischoff-Grethe, Amanda, A technique for the deidentification of structural brain MR images, Human Brain Mapping, 28, 9, pp. 892-903, (2007)","","American Society of Neuroradiology","","","","","","1936959X; 01956108","","AAJND","39532533","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004697120"

This analysis is designed to understand patient expectations of healthcare AI. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional nationally representative survey of US adults fielded from June to July of 2023. A total of 2039 participants completed the survey and cross-sectional population weights were applied to produce national estimates. Results: Among US adults, 19.55% expect AI to improve their relationship with their doctor, while 19.4% expect it to increase affordability and 30.28% expect it will improve their access to care. Trust in providers and the healthcare system are positively associated with expectations of AI when controlling for demographic factors, general attitudes toward technology, and other healthcare-related variables. Discussion: US adults generally have low expectations of benefit from AI in healthcare, but those with higher trust in their providers and health systems are more likely to expect to benefit from AI. Conclusion: Trust and provider relationships should be key considerations for health systems as they create their AI governance processes and communicate with patients about AI tools. Evidence of patient benefit should be prioritized to preserve or promote trust. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","access to care; AI governance; artificial intelligence; patient trust; patient-provider relationships","adult; article; artificial intelligence; cross-sectional study; expectation; female; health care; health care access; health care system; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient expectation; pharmacoeconomics; physician; trust; United States; adolescent; aged; doctor patient relationship; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physician-Patient Relations; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) [grant number 5R01EB030492-04].","Trustworthy AI Tai Playbook, (2021); Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, (2022); Health Affairs Forefront, (2024); Hill, Harry, Cost-Effectiveness of AI for Risk-Stratified Breast Cancer Screening, JAMA Network Open, 7, 9, (2024); Nejm AI, (2024); Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework AI Rmf 1 0, (2023); Bedoya, Armando D., A framework for the oversight and local deployment of safe and high-quality prediction models, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 29, 9, pp. 1631-1636, (2022); Callahan, Alison, Standing on FURM Ground: A Framework for Evaluating Fair, Useful, and Reliable AI Models in Health Care Systems, NEJM Catalyst Innovations in Care Delivery, 5, 10, (2024); De Hond, Anne, Guidelines and quality criteria for artificial intelligence-based prediction models in healthcare: a scoping review, npj Digital Medicine, 5, 1, (2022); Nelson, Caroline A., Patient Perspectives on the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Skin Cancer Screening: A Qualitative Study, JAMA Dermatology, 156, 5, pp. 501-512, (2020)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","1527974X; 10675027","","JAMAF","40036944","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003771274"

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of anal incontinence in the young population and to address the reasons why such individuals do not seek care. Methods: This was a public health survey conducted using personal and professional social networks between April and November 2023. Participants between the ages of 18 and 65 were invited to respond a survey about their experience of anal incontinence (AI). The survey collected data on the Vaizey's score and the Anal Incontinence Quality of Life Index (FIQL). Results: Of the 481 individuals who completed the survey, 176 (36.6 %) reported experiencing AI. The majority of respondents exhibited mild incontinence (46 %), while 15.8 % experienced severe or major AI. Among those with AI, only 27.3 % consulted a physician, and in nearly 40 % of cases, no treatment was proposed. The primary reasons for not seeking consultation were embarrassment about the condition (63 %) and perceived stigma surrounding treatment (28 %), including a lack of awareness about available treatments. Multivariate analysis revealed that individuals between the ages of 26 and 45 were more likely to seek medical attention. Conclusion: The prevalence of incontinence of the anal nature among young adults remains significantly underestimated, despite its impact on their quality of life. Enhanced public health communication regarding the management of incontinence, particularly among young individuals and healthcare providers, is imperative. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anal incontinence; Female; Male; Quality of life; Young people","antidiarrheal agent; abdominoperineal physiotherapy; adult; aged; Article; consultation; controlled study; coping; depression; disease severity; disease severity assessment; embarrassment; Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Index; feces incontinence; female; flatulence; human; lifestyle; liquid feces; male; physiotherapy; prevalence; quality of life; quality of life assessment; social network; stigma; Vaizey score; adolescent; epidemiology; health survey; middle aged; patient attitude; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Social Networking; Young Adult","","","The authors acknowledge the university of Angers, the National Health Authority, France Assos Sant\u00E9 and the university hospital of Angers for having shared the survey.","Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, (2023); Sharma, A., Systematic review of the prevalence of faecal incontinence, British Journal of Surgery, 103, 12, pp. 1589-1597, (2016); Sperber, Ami D., Worldwide Prevalence and Burden of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Results of Rome Foundation Global Study, Gastroenterology, 160, 1, pp. 99-114.e3, (2021); Boreham, Muriel K., Anal incontinence in women presenting for gynecologic care: Prevalence, risk factors, and impact upon quality of life, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 192, 5 SPEC.

This study focuses on ARFood, a serious game designed to teach Generation Alpha about nutritional health and environmental sustainability. The objective is to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the app’s AI-driven feedback mechanisms in achieving specific educational goals in these domains. Methods: ARFood features two AI-powered Non-Player Characters (NPCs), each programmed to evaluate virtual shopping carts created by users. The nutritional NPC provides feedback on dietary choices, while the sustainability NPC assesses environmental impacts. Ninety-three participants were involved, generating 83 virtual carts that were evaluated by both NPCs. Each NPC’s feedback was assessed for alignment with five predefined educational objectives per theme using a zero-shot RoBERTa classifier. An iterative process was employed to refine the NPC prompts, increase the weight of underrepresented objectives, and re-evaluate virtual carts until all objectives were satisfactorily addressed. Results: Initial evaluations revealed uneven alignment across educational objectives, particularly in areas such as resource conservation and balanced diet planning. Prompt refinement led to a significant improvement in feedback quality, with the final iterations demonstrating comprehensive coverage of all educational objectives. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of AR and AI in creating adaptive educational tools.

Design: A descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional research. Methods: This study was conducted between January and February 2024 with 170 nurses actively working in paediatric clinics in Turkey. The data collection tools included the Nurse Information Form, the General Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS), the Artificial Intelligence Literacy Scale (AILS) and the Artificial Intelligence Anxiety Scale (AIAS). To determine the associations between the variables, the data was analysed using IBM SPSS 28, which included linear regression and Pearson correlation analysis. Results: The study indicated significant positive correlations between paediatric nurses' age and their AIAS scores (r =.226; p <.01) and significant negative correlations between paediatric nurses' age and their AILS (r = −.192; p <.05) and GAAIS scores (r = −.152; p <.05). The GAAIS was significantly predictive (p <.000) and accounted for 50% of the variation in AIAS and AILS scores. Conclusion: Paediatric nurses' attitudes towards AI significantly predicted AI literacy and AI anxiety. The relationship between the age of the paediatric nurses and the anxiety, AI literacy and attitudes towards AI was demonstrated. Healthcare and educational institutions should create customized training programs and awareness-raising activities for older nurses, as there are noticeable variations in the attitudes of paediatric nurses towards AI based on their age. Implications for Profession and/or Patient Care: Providing in-service AI training can help healthcare organizations improve paediatric nurses' attitudes towards AI, increase their AI literacy and reduce their anxiety. This training has the potential to impact their attitudes positively and reduce their anxiety. Reporting Method: The study results were critically reported using STROBE criteria.

Utilizing a Generative AI (GenAI) application, we created a virtual persona, ""Wanda"", to promote cancer awareness on Instagram. Methods: We created five posts, addressing the five most modifiable risk factors for cancer: tobacco consumption, unhealthy diet, sun exposure, alcohol consumption, and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To amplify the campaign's reach, posts were boosted using a custom-targeted as well as an automated advertisement algorithm. An overall budget of €100 was equally distributed between the two algorithms. Campaign performance was assessed based on the number of users reached and the age distribution of the audience. Results: The campaign achieved a total of 9902 recognitions, with a cost-efficiency analysis revealing an average expenditure of €0.013 per reach. The most economical intervention achieved a cost of only €0.006 per reach. In comparing the two advertisement strategies, we observed similar overall reach but noted differences in the age demographics of the audience. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of combining generative AI with strategically targeted advertisement to promote cancer prevention messages effectively, with minimal time and financial investment. We discuss chances presented by GenAI applications in health communication, their implication, and the impact of parasocial relationships on content perception.

This study aimed to explore the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices of undergraduate medical students regarding the use of ChatGPT and similar chatbots in their academic work. METHODS: An anonymous, structured questionnaire was developed using Google Forms and administered to medical students as part of a cross-sectional study. The survey targeted undergraduate medical students from four governorates in Egypt. The questionnaire link was distributed through social media platforms, including Facebook and WhatsApp. The survey comprised four sections: socio-demographic characteristics, perceptions, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS: The survey achieved a response rate of 96%, with 614 out of 640 approached students participating. Prior to the study, most respondents (78.5%) had personal experience using it. Overall, respondents demonstrated positive perceptions, attitudes, and practices toward ChatGPT, with mean scores exceeding 3 for all three variables: 3.99 ± 0.60 for perceptions, 3.01 ± 0.46 for attitudes, and 3.55 ± 0.55 for practices. In general, the students exhibited a high degree of trust in the model, with approximately half trusting the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by ChatGPT. However, more than two-thirds expressed apprehension about its potential misuse in medical education, and around 60% were concerned about the accuracy of information ChatGPT might generate on complex medical topics. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students show strong interest and trust in using ChatGPT and similar chatbots for academic purposes but have concerns about the reliability of the information and potential misuse in medical education. The use of AI tools should follow ethical guidelines set by academic institutions, with regular updates to keep pace with technological progress. Future research should focus on the impact of AI on education and personal development, especially among young people.

Numerous studies have shown that the presence of AI is associated with a higher frequency of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and osteoporosis. This increased morbidity is mostly related to mild autonomous cortisol secretion, which is the most common hormonal abnormality in these patients. It is well known that glucocorticoid excess affects the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, brain structures involved in mood regulation and cognitive processes, leading to a wide range of psychiatric symptoms, including depression. While these effects are well documented in patients with Cushing's syndrome, data on mental health changes in patients with AIs remain scarce. Additionally, the few existing studies have several limitations, leaving important clinical questions unanswered. Consequently, the extent to which AIs are associated with impaired mental health and whether patients would benefit from surgical treatment remains unclear. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing adequate management strategies. This review explores potential psychological and psychiatric implications of AIs. By synthesizing existing literature, we aim to explain the relationship between AIs and mental health disorders, providing a background for future research and clinical practice guidelines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adrenal incidentaloma; cognitive impairment; depression; mental health; mild autonomous cortisol secretion","glucocorticoid; adrenal disease; adrenal incidentaloma; adult; clinical practice guideline; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; Cushing syndrome; depression; diagnosis; dyslipidemia; female; hippocampus; human; hydrocortisone release; hypertension; male; mental disease; mental health; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; osteoporosis; prefrontal cortex; review; young adult; adrenal tumor; complication; etiology; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adrenal incidentaloma; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health","","","","Fassnacht, Martin, European Society of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines on the management of adrenal incidentalomas, in collaboration with the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors, European Journal of Endocrinology, 189, 1, pp. G1-G42, (2023); Elhassan, Yasir S., Natural History of Adrenal Incidentalomas with and without Mild Autonomous Cortisol Excess A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 171, 2, pp. 107-116, (2019); Lopez, Diana M., Nonfunctional"" adrenal Tumors and the risk for incident diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes: A cohort study, Annals of Internal Medicine, 165, 8, pp. 533-542, (2016); Arruda, Mariana, The presence of nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas increases arterial hypertension frequency and severity, and is associated with cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression test, Journal of Human Hypertension, 32, 1, pp. 3-11, (2017); Pelsma, Iris Catharina Maria, Comorbidities in mild autonomous cortisol secretion and the effect of treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis, European Journal of Endocrinology, 189, 4, pp. S88-S101, (2023); Prete, Alessandro, Cardiometabolic Disease Burden and Steroid Excretion in Benign Adrenal Tumors A Cross-Sectional Multicenter Study, Annals of Internal Medicine, 175, 3, pp. 325-334, (2022); Reimondo, Giuseppe, Adrenal incidentalomas are tied to increased risk of diabetes: Findings from a prospective study, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 105, 4, pp. E973-E981, (2020); Rahimi, Leili, Kidney Function in Patients With Adrenal Adenomas: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 109, 9, pp. e1750-e1758, (2024); Morelli, Valentina, Risk of new vertebral fractures in patients with adrenal incidentaloma with and without subclinical hypercortisolism: A multicenter longitudinal study, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 26, 8, pp. 1816-1821, (2011); Dogra, Prerna, High prevalence of frailty in patients with adrenal adenomas and adrenocortical hormone excess: a cross-sectional multi-centre study with prospective enrolment, European Journal of Endocrinology, 189, 3, pp. 318-326, (2023)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","08044643; 1479683X","","EJOEE","39891589","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218492192"

Traditional methods of assessing LDA, reliant on questionnaires, often face limitations because of participants' inability or potential bias. This study introduces emoLDAnet, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven psychological framework that leverages video-recorded conversations to detect negative emotions through the analysis of facial expressions and physiological signals. We recruited 50 participants to undergo questionnaires and interviews, with their responses recorded on video. The emoLDAnet employs a combination of deep learning (e.g., VGG11) and machine learning (e.g., decision trees [DTs]) to identify emotional states. The emoLDAnet incorporates the OCC–PAD–LDA psychological transformation model, enhancing the interpretability of AI decisions by translating facial expressions into psychologically meaningful data. Results indicate that emoLDAnet achieves high detection rates for loneliness, depression, and anxiety, with F1-scores exceeding 80% and Kendall's correlation coefficients above 0.5, demonstrating strong agreement with traditional scales. The study underscores the importance of the OCC–PAD–LDA model in improving screening accuracy and the significant impact of machine learning classifiers on the framework's performance.

Rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm have soared while well-being has declined. This mental health crisis has coincided with increased use of smartphones and social media, the extended isolation and suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and attacks on reproductive rights. These recent stressors have compounded the historic challenges women and girls have always faced while growing up, at school, in society, and in the workplace. In this paper, we examine the mental health effects of social media on young people, focusing on females. In an effort to address the current crisis, we designed a mobile app, Girltelligence, that provides a safe online space for girls and young women to advise and support one another on any topics without judgment and without the negative mental health impacts associated with mainstream social media. Girltelligence achieves this by offering a safe environment monitored by both AI and human moderators and tailored by age. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Children S Social Networks and Social Supports, (1989); Benenson, Joyce F., The development of human female competition: Allies and adversaries, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 368, 1631, (2013); Björkqvist, Kaj, Gender differences in aggression, Current Opinion in Psychology, 19, pp. 39-42, (2018); Meeting at the Crossroads Women S Psychology and Girls Development, (1992); Burstein, Brett, Suicidal Attempts and Ideation among Children and Adolescents in US Emergency Departments, 2007-2015, JAMA Pediatrics, 173, 6, pp. 598-600, (2019); Cybulski, Łukasz, Temporal trends in annual incidence rates for psychiatric disorders and self-harm among children and adolescents in the UK, 2003–2018, BMC Psychiatry, 21, 1, (2021); DeAndrea, David Christopher, Online peer support for mental health problems in the United States:2004-2010, Psychological Medicine, 43, 11, pp. 2277-2288, (2013); Fardouly, Jasmine, Parental Control of the Time Preadolescents Spend on Social Media: Links with Preadolescents’ Social Media Appearance Comparisons and Mental Health, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 47, 7, pp. 1456-1468, (2018); Hunt, Melissa G., No more FOMO: Limiting social media decreases loneliness and depression, Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 37, 10, pp. 751-768, (2018); Hyde, Janet Shibley, Gender Differences in Depression: Biological, Affective, Cognitive, and Sociocultural Factors, Harvard Review of Psychiatry, 28, 1, pp. 4-13, (2020)","","First Monday","","","","","","13960466","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218757981"

Design/Methodology/Approach: Researchers targeted Kaifeng high school and university students for data collection. For educational initiatives, this group is important and able to share information throughout their communities. In order to test the proposed relationships, Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized. Findings: With CRP and EngAIL acting as mediators, AI-Net has a considerable impact on the production of PHA Int. The results suggest that cultural relevance and engagement have a greater effect on health awareness intentions when compared to HAU. Practical Implications: The analysis demonstrates that AI has the capability to deliver both culturally relevant and engaging health education. AI Technology allows health campaigns to easily promote fluoride awareness to students attending high school and university, who are already at ease with this technology. Theoretical Implications: This study expands the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) by stressing the vital importance of cultural applicability and involvement in AI-integrated health communication. Originality/Value: This body of research highlights the way AI technology can enrich public health messaging, placing importance on engagement and cultural adaptation in changing health behaviors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","as well as high school and university students; awareness around public health; Content enhanced with AI; cultural relevance; engagement; fluoride","fluoride; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; awareness; common method bias; comprehension; conceptual framework; cultural relevance perception; discriminant validity; educational status; elaboration likelihood model; engagement; female; health behavior; health education; health survey; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; medical information; middle aged; perception; public health; public health campaign; questionnaire; statistical model; structural equation modeling; text messaging; university student; young adult","","fluoride, 16984-48-8","","Grandjean, Philippe A., Neurobehavioural effects of developmental toxicity, The Lancet Neurology, 13, 3, pp. 330-338, (2014); Grandjean, Philippe A., Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: An updated review, Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source, 18, 1, (2019); Zawacki-Richter, Olaf, Systematic review of research on artificial intelligence applications in higher education – where are the educators?, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 16, 1, (2019); Zhi, Liu, Profiling students’ learning engagement in MOOC discussions to identify learning achievement: An automated configurational approach, Computers and Education, 219, (2024); Lacson, Carl Francis Z., Fluoride-containing water: A global perspective and a pursuit to sustainable water defluoridation management -An overview, Journal of Cleaner Production, 280, (2021); Zhou, Guoyu, Low-to-moderate fluoride exposure, relative mitochondrial DNA levels, and dental fluorosis in Chinese children, Environment International, 127, pp. 70-77, (2019); Kitchen, Philip James, The elaboration likelihood model: Review, critique and research agenda, European Journal of Marketing, 48, 11-12, pp. 2033-2050, (2014); Landrigan, PJ J., Principles for prevention of the toxic effects of metals, 1, pp. 685-703, (2021); Schlusselwerke Der Medienwirkungsforschung, (2016); Cacioppo, John T., Effects of need for cognition on message evaluation, recall, and persuasion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, 4, pp. 805-818, (1983)","","International Society for Fluoride Research","","","","","","00154725; 22534083","","FLUOA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218415531"

Some quantitative studies report increased emotional problems and depression; others report improved mental health and well-being. Qualitative explorations reveal heterogeneity, with themes ranging from feelings of loss to growth and development. Objective: This study aims to analyze free-text responses from children and young people participating in the Children and Young People With Long COVID study to get a clearer understanding of how young people were feeling during the pandemic. Methods: A total of 8224 free-text responses from children and young people were analyzed using InfraNodus, an artificial intelligence–powered text network analysis tool, to determine the most prevalent topics. A random subsample of 411 (5%) of the 8224 responses underwent a manual sentiment analysis; this was reweighted to represent the general population of children and young people in England. Results: Experiences fell into 6 main overlapping topical clusters: school, examination stress, mental health, emotional impact of the pandemic, social and family support, and physical health (including COVID-19 symptoms). Sentiment analysis showed that statements were largely negative (314/411, 76.4%), with a small proportion being positive (57/411, 13.9%). Those reporting negative sentiment were mostly female (227/314, 72.3%), while those reporting positive sentiment were mostly older (170/314, 54.1%). There were significant observed associations between sentiment and COVID-19 status as well as sex (P=.001 and P<.001, respectively) such that the majority of the responses, regardless of COVID-19 status or sex, were negative; for example, 84.1% (227/270) of the responses from female individuals and 61.7% (87/141) of those from male individuals were negative. There were no observed associations between sentiment and all other examined demographics. The results were broadly similar when reweighted to the general population of children and young people in England: 78.52% (negative), 13.23% (positive), and 8.24% (neutral). Conclusions: We used InfraNodus to analyze free-text responses from a large sample of children and young people. The majority of responses (314/411, 76.4%) were negative, and many of the children and young people reported experiencing distress across a range of domains related to school, social situations, and mental health. Our findings add to the literature, highlighting the importance of specific considerations for children and young people when responding to national emergencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; artificial intelligence; children and young people; COVID-19; discourse analysis; experiences; free-text responses; InfraNodus; long COVID; sentiment analysis; text mining","adolescent; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; child; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; discourse analysis; distress syndrome; England; family support; female; human; long COVID; major clinical study; male; mental health; network analysis; pandemic; quantitative study; school child; sentiment analysis; young adult; emotion; epidemiology; mental stress; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social support; Adolescent; Child; COVID-19; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Support; Stress, Psychological","","","This work is independent research jointly funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI; Children and Young People With Long COVID study; COV-LT-0022).

Decreasing the risk of GDM can interrupt the intergenerational cycle of diabetes in AI/AN families, and can decrease diabetes-related health disparities. The goal of this study was to explore ways of supporting holistic health and reducing the risk of GDM among young American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) females prior to pregnancy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult AI/AN women (>18 years) who had GDM or who have young female relatives (e.g., daughters) (n = 41), AI/AN females between 12 and 24 years (n = 18), and key experts in food/nutrition and health within AI/AN communities (n = 32). Three themes emerged: (1) guidance on how to support young females’ holistic wellness; (2) evidence that generations of colonial violence, including forced removal, forced poverty, and the imposition of a Western-based food system, causes deeper, systemic fracturing of traditional cultural food knowledge and practices; and the fact that (3) opportunities for improved adolescent female health are rooted in AI/AN values and how AI/AN people resist the impacts of anti-Indigenous racism through family-based, community-led, and holistic health. These themes suggest alternative understandings about the relationships between food insecurity and holistic pre-pregnancy health and can guide our next steps in decreasing health disparities in these communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescent females; American Indian and Alaska native; culturally centered; diabetes risk reduction; food and nutrition insecurity; gestational diabetes risk reduction; holistic wellness; Indigenous; pre-pregnancy; traditional foods","diabetes; food intake; health risk; pregnancy; womens health; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; community care; conceptual framework; data analysis; daughter; diabetes mellitus; ethnicity; fatigue; female; food assistance; food insecurity; gestational diabetes; health care personnel; health disparity; human; interview; major clinical study; nutrition; philosophy; physical activity; poverty; qualitative research; racism; risk reduction; semi structured interview; Alaska Native; American Indian; prevention and control; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alaska Natives; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Holistic Health; Humans; Indians, North American; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Risk Reduction Behavior; Young Adult","","","This research was funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R21MD016126; PI Stotz) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (P30DK092923; MPI Manson, Brega).","Satterfield, Dawn W., Health Promotion and Diabetes Prevention in American Indian and Alaska Native Communities--Traditional Foods Project, 2008-2014, MMWR supplements, 65, 1, pp. 4-10, (2016); Humanities, (2016); Paradies, Yin C., Racism as a determinant of health: A systematic review and meta-analysis, PLOS ONE, 10, 9, (2015); Stanley, Linda R., The Imperative for Research to Promote Health Equity in Indigenous Communities, Prevention Science, 21, pp. 13-21, (2020); Fujimoto, Wilfred Y., Gestational diabetes in high-risk populations, Clinical Diabetes, 31, 2, pp. 90-94, (2013); Pettitt, David Dj, The vicious cycle of diabetes and pregnancy, Current Diabetes Reports, 7, 4, pp. 295-297, (2007); Definitions of Food Security, (2025); Bawadi, Hiba Ahmad, Food insecurity is related to glycemic control deterioration in patients with type 2 diabetes, Clinical Nutrition, 31, 2, pp. 250-254, (2012); Lyles, Courtney Rees, Food insecurity in relation to changes in hemoglobin A1c, self-efficacy, and fruit/vegetable intake during a diabetes educational intervention, Diabetes Care, 36, 6, pp. 1448-1453, (2013); Teufel-Shone, Nicolette I., Demographic characteristics and food choices of participants in the special diabetes program for american Indians diabetes prevention demonstration project, Ethnicity and Health, 20, 4, pp. 327-340, (2015)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","16604601; 16617827","","","39857477","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215941362"

Unlike task-oriented chatbots, social chatbots build relationships and provide social support, which can positively impact mental health outcomes like loneliness and social anxiety. However, the specific effects and mechanisms through which these chatbots influence mental health remain underexplored. Objective: This study explores the mental health potential of AI social chatbots, focusing on their impact on loneliness and social anxiety among university students. The study seeks to (i) assess the impact of engaging with an AI social chatbot in South Korea, ""Luda Lee,"" on these mental health outcomes over a 4-week period and (ii) analyze user experiences to identify perceived strengths and weaknesses, as well as the applicability of social chatbots in therapeutic contexts. Methods: A single-group pre-post study was conducted with university students who interacted with the chatbot for 4 weeks. Measures included loneliness, social anxiety, and mood-related symptoms such as depression, assessed at baseline, week 2, and week 4. Quantitative measures were analyzed using analysis of variance and stepwise linear regression to identify the factors affecting change. Thematic analysis was used to analyze user experiences and assess the perceived benefits and challenges of chatbots. Results: A total of 176 participants (88 males, average age=22.6 (SD 2.92)) took part in the study. Baseline measures indicated slightly elevated levels of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale, mean 27.97, SD (11.07)) and social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, mean 25.3, SD (14.19)) compared to typical university students. Significant reductions were observed as loneliness decreasing by week 2 (t<inf>175</inf>=2.55, P=.02) and social anxiety decreasing by week 4 (t<inf>175</inf>=2.67, P=.01). Stepwise linear regression identified baseline loneliness (β=0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89), self-disclosure (β=–0.65, 95% CI –1.07 to –0.23) and resilience (β=0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.13) as significant predictors of week 4 loneliness (R2=0.64). Baseline social anxiety (β=0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.03) significantly predicted week 4 anxiety (R2=0.65). These findings indicate higher baseline loneliness, lower self-disclosure to the chatbot, and higher resilience significantly predicted higher loneliness at week 4. Additionally, higher baseline social anxiety significantly predicted higher social anxiety at week 4. Qualitative analysis highlighted the chatbot's empathy and support as features for reliability, though issues such as inconsistent responses and excessive enthusiasm occasionally disrupted user immersion. Conclusions: Social chatbots may have the potential to mitigate feelings of loneliness and social anxiety, indicating their possible utility as complementary resources in mental health interventions. User insights emphasize the importance of empathy, accessibility, and structured conversations in achieving therapeutic goals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; artificial intelligence; exploratory research; loneliness; mixed methods study; social anxiety; social chatbot","adult; analysis of variance; anxiety disorder; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical assessment; comparative study; Connor Davidson resilience scale; depression; empathy; exploratory research; female; follow up; human; immersion; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale; linear regression analysis; loneliness; male; mental health; mood disorder; outcome assessment; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; Perceived Stress Scale; personal experience; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; post hoc analysis; psychological resilience; qualitative analysis; reliability; self disclosure; social anxiety; social support; South Korea; symptom; thematic analysis; UCLA Loneliness Scale; university student; young adult; anxiety; psychology; student; therapy; university; Adult; Anxiety; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Republic of Korea; Social Support; Students; Universities; Young Adult","","","We are grateful to Scatter Lab Inc for an active research collaboration.

We conducted an anonymous online survey completed by Latina teens who read the zines (32 for sexual health and 33 for mental health). Data analysis aimed to explore, summarize, and interpret the collected data using an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced approach. Survey participants found the zine format and content acceptable and engaging with the zines had several positive impacts on Latina teens, influencing their emotions, knowledge, and perspectives. The digital zines resonated with Latina teens, providing accessible and engaging content for exploring sexual and mental health topics. This study resulted in valuable insights into the use of AI-enhanced approaches to data analysis and the potential effectiveness of digital zines as a health communication strategy among Latina teens. However, further validation through larger-scale studies with more robust methodologies is needed. Our findings show that zines can be leveraged as an effective health communication tool among Latina teens, providing preliminary evidence that can be used to support zine development and dissemination initiatives within additional communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","arts/arts in health promotion; child/adolescent health; Latino/Latina/Latinx or Hispanic; mental health; sexual health; surveys","adolescent; artificial intelligence; Caucasian; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; medical information; mental health; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; sexual health; Adolescent; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Health Communication; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Mental Health; Sexual Health; Surveys and Questionnaires; White","","","This research was supported by the Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation Faculty Grant Program, the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service Faculty Research Development Fund, and the Fordham University Faculty Research Grant.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe the perceptions and awareness of artificial intelligence technologies in a population of practicing pharmacists across the United States. Methods: A 19-question electronic survey was administered via Qualtrics to assess various AI perceptions among U.S. pharmacists. The survey ran from September 5th to November 22nd, 2023 and targeted practicing pharmacists through professional organizations and publicly available email lists. Responses were analyzed for descriptive trends and demographic analysis focusing on factors predicting AI use and were categorized into sub-focuses for detailed analysis. Results: A total of 1363 practicing pharmacists completed the survey. 82.5% of respondents expressed some degree of familiarity with AI software, but only 38.7% reported having used AI. Of those using AI software, the most common applications were Large Language Models (33.7%) and Image Generation (10%). 56.1% of pharmacists feel that AI will decrease the number of pharmacy jobs, and 34.9% of pharmacists express some degree of distrust of AI. Despite this, 64.1% of pharmacists feel that AI could enhance their professional effectiveness and productivity. Males appear much more likely than females to use AI (50.1% Vs. 31%, P < .001). Younger responders also reported higher AI utilization with the highest utilization aged 23–29 (47.5%) and lowest in 60+ (25.6%, P < .001) Conclusion: Understanding pharmacists' current awareness, concerns, and perspectives on AI is crucial for navigating its potential impact on the profession including potential professional utilization, addressing concerns regarding job security, ethical considerations, and regulatory uncertainty. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; age; aptitude; Article; artificial intelligence; awareness; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; data analysis; demographics; demography; distrust; e-mail; female; gender; generative model; health care survey; health care utilization; human; large language model; male; medical society; middle aged; perception; pharmacist; population; productivity; trust; United States; work; health personnel attitude; pharmacy (shop); professional standard; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Pharmaceutical Services; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","undefined; Paul, Debleena, Artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development, Drug Discovery Today, 26, 1, pp. 80-93, (2021); Raza, Muhammad Ahmer, Transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence in pharmacy practice, Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal, 31, 9, (2023); Rai, Akriti, Review on the Artificial Intelligence-based Nanorobotics Targeted Drug Delivery System for Brain-specific Targeting, Current Pharmaceutical Design, 29, 44, pp. 3519-3531, (2023); Bu, Fengjiao, Artificial intelligence-based internet hospital pharmacy services in China: Perspective based on a case study, Frontiers in Pharmacology, 13, (2022); Wong, Adrian L., Role of artificial intelligence in pharmacy practice: A narrative review, JACCP Journal of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy, 6, 11, pp. 1237-1250, (2023); Chalasani, Sri Harsha, Artificial intelligence in the field of pharmacy practice: A literature review, Exploratory Research in Clinical and Social Pharmacy, 12, (2023); Beavers, Jennifer R., Evaluation of inpatient medication guidance from an artificial intelligence chatbot, American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, 80, 24, pp. 1822-1829, (2023); Hammour, Khawla Abu, ChatGPT in pharmacy practice: a cross-sectional exploration of Jordanian pharmacists' perception, practice, and concerns, Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice, 16, 1, (2023); Alowais, Shuroug A., Revolutionizing healthcare: the role of artificial intelligence in clinical practice, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15443191; 15443450","","","39615589","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212930869"

Adolescent health education is associated with positive health and educational outcomes, yet young people experience barriers to fully engaging in learning about health issues that are often unique to their social location. Barriers for successful engagement in health education for African diaspora youth in North American and European contexts may include school initiatives built around engagement models that do not center Black youth; for Black youth in majority-Black societies, barriers may include access to resources or exclusionary practices based on other social characteristics. Global health promotion has used a variety of multimodal educational tools from radio to more recently online engagement, especially in African contexts, to reach young people. This essay shares experiences using AI and in-person facilitation to engage in community health education with youth in Liberia and the United States. In our practice, we found that there are far more underlying systemic and structural similarities to the inequities experienced between African and Black American youth and that utilizing AI tools alongside of in-person discussion may contribute to better outcomes for youth health education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","child/adolescent health; health education; international/cross-cultural health; social determinants of health; social marketing/health communication","adolescent; African American; Caucasian; coronavirus disease 2019; health education; health promotion; human; Liberia; organization and management; United States; Adolescent; Black or African American; COVID-19; Health Education; Health Promotion; Humans; White","","","","Bibauw, Serge, DIALOGUE SYSTEMS FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING: Chatbots and Beyond, pp. 121-135, (2022); Competing Frameworks Global and National in Citizenship Education, (2018); Delany-Moretlwe, Sinead, Providing comprehensive health services for young key populations: Needs, barriers and gaps, Journal of the International AIDS Society, 18, 2, pp. 29-40, (2015); Dennison, Laura, Opportunities and challenges for smartphone applications in supporting health behavior change: Qualitative study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15, 4, (2013); Combating Anti Blackness in the Ai Community, (2020); Wennberg, Maria, Poor breakfast habits in adolescence predict the metabolic syndrome in adulthood, Public Health Nutrition, 18, 1, pp. 122-129, (2015)","","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","15248399","","","37843001","English","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174300399"

Artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, provides a potential opportunity to increase access to sexual consent information and education. However, what ChatGPT knows about sexual consent and if this aligns with the current evidence-based literature on sexual consent is unclear. The goal of this research commentary was to explore what ChatGPT knows about sexual consent with a focus on: 1) the definition of consent, 2) how consent could be communicated, and 3) the impact that substances have on consent. We also examined the reliability of ChatGPT’s responses by having three different researchers ask ChatGPT the same set of questions. Across our questions, ChatGPT provided similar and comprehensive responses that discussed key features of consent–that consent is freely given or reversible. ChatGPT provided examples of different verbal and nonverbal cues people can use to communicate and interpret consent and discussed the ways that substances can impact consent communication. Overall, ChatGPT could be a potential resource for educators and young people who seek information about sexual consent; however, we should proceed with caution.

This study sought to document the Indigenous determinants of health (IDOH) in AI/AN communities that shaped mental wellbeing for four groups: educators, traditional knowledge holders/practitioners, first responders, and substance abuse recovery community, during the pandemic. This work was a collaboration with and had research approval from three Native nations in Arizona. In-depth interviews were conducted from May to November 2021; 92 participants were interviewed. The most prevalent IDOH and associated themes included strategies to cope with emotional and social stressors and the impact on physical and mental health, relationships, kinship, cultural continuity, and self-determination. The groups experienced differences in mental wellbeing aligned with their occupation. For example, first responders experienced disruption and social dissonance in the workplace due to varying political views, and traditional knowledge holders/ practitioners experienced a revitalization of cultural strategies to maintain health. Although the differences between occupational groups are striking, the similarities that did exist were grounded in Indigenous identity and worldview that emphasize relationships and connection to the natural environment.

Teachers rely on anecdotal records, checklists, and rating scales to translate these observations into insights that inform lesson planning and individualized support. However, manual behavior observation faces several practical obstacles. Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) with teacher expertise offers a path to overcome these limitations by automating data capture and preliminary analysis. The proposed framework processes teacher-recorded images or video clips through a series of consecutive stages. The skeletal joint coordinates are extracted and passed to specialized classifiers that recognize and label discrete behaviors (for example, block play or outdoor activity). A large language model (LLM) is applied to these structured records to generate coherent narrative-style daily observation reports aligned with the five domains of the KICCE Preschool Observation Scale (physical-motor & health, communication, social relationships, artistic experiences, and nature exploration). A teacher dash-board visualizes participation trends, highlights strengths and areas that need support, and links to supporting media snapshots. A small-scale survey (n=10) asked teachers to evaluate the coherence, completeness, and practical usefulness of each report on a five-point Likert scale. A comparative study across multiple large language models is planned to evaluate their impact on narrative quality and report accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children Education; HuG-M; mobile application","Artificial intelligence; Social aspects; Teaching; Analysis system; Assessment system; Behavior analysis; Child educations; Early childhoods; HuG-M; Language model; Mobile applications; Teachers'; Young children; Quality control","","","","Published by Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health and Welfare; IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, (2022); Yolov3 an Incremental Improvement, (2018); Wojke, Nicolai, Simple online and realtime tracking with a deep association metric, Proceedings - International Conference on Image Processing, ICIP, 2017-September, pp. 3645-3649, (2017); Llama 3 Herd of Models, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","BK21 Plus Project, University of Ulsan; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); Korea Tourism Organization; Ulsan Culture and Tourism Foundation","5th International Workshop on Intelligent Systems, IWIS 2025","","Ulsan","212020","","9798331502577","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105017127817"

However, the evidence on how early relational health ‘gets under the skin’ to impact the developing brain remains unclear. Here, we provide a scoping review of the extant literature and synthesize evidence on the link between relational health from conception to age three and subsequent brain structure, function, and connectivity. Literature searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases yielded 7156 studies. Screening of studies was conducted on the Living Knowledge System (an AI-assisted screening tool), which resulted in 79 studies being included in the review. Results were synthesized based on the type of relational health examined, type of imaging modality (e.g., electroencephalogram, structural, and functional magnetic resonance imaging), and developmental stage. We identified studies of the relationship between early relational health and brain structure, function, and connectivity that spanned from childhood to young adulthood, with no research beyond this age period. There was evidence for early relational health to be associated with patterns of brain activation that may reflect the experience of more positive emotions and reduced risk for psychopathology. However, few studies examined longitudinal changes in brain structure, function, and connectivity. Even fewer have examined relational health beyond the mother–infant bond. Future research is needed to improve understanding of the impact of relational health on brain development and to ascertain whether such impacts reflect a mechanism linking relational health with health and wellbeing across the lifespan. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brain development; Mother-infant; Neurobiology; Parent-infant; Relational health","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

In particular, ovarian health is critical since the ovaries regulate hormonal functions that influence many bodily systems. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder, frequently undiagnosed, posing significant health risks and long-term complications for young women, including infertility and metabolic disturbances. Early and accurate detection using numerical assessments and ultrasound imaging is essential for effective management.

The increasing number of MBS among young patients has led to more post-bariatric pregnancies. Our study investigates how breastfeeding duration impacts postpartum weight retention and health outcomes for mothers and babies after MBS. Methods: MOMBARIS (Maternal Outcomes of Bariatric Surgery and Pregnancy Study) is a multicentre study. The population is derived from MOMBARIS 2, which focused on obstetric outcomes. It included patients who became pregnant following MBS, analysing pre-operative metrics, type of surgery, pregnancy details, and breastfeeding duration. Data analysis was conducted using Julius.ai. Results: We analysed 156 patients post-MBS, with 148 pregnancies leading to childbirth. Among them, 131 had laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), 12 underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and 5 had one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). The mean age was 31.7 ± 5.45 years (range 19–48) with a pre-operative BMI of 43.9 kg/m2 ± 5.8 kg/m2 (range 31.9–68.8). The mean %EWL was 72% (± 28.6). Seventeen patients had multiple children. Breastfeeding results indicated that 116 patients (78.4%) initiated breastfeeding, with 40.5% continuing beyond 6 months. No significant differences were found in BMI metrics across breastfeeding groups. Conclusions: Bariatric outcomes (%EWL, %TWL) show no statistical difference based on breastfeeding patterns, nor does breastfeeding significantly affect weight loss maintenance post-surgery. Additionally, delaying pregnancy after surgery does not guarantee more significant weight loss. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Breastfeeding; Metabolic bariatric surgery; Pregnancy; Weight loss","","","","","Gloy, Viktoria Luise, Bariatric surgery versus non-surgical treatment for obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials., BMJ, 347, (2013); Colquitt, Jill L., Surgery for obesity, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2, (2009); Wu, Zhenpeng, Long-Term Results of Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents with at Least 5 Years of Follow-up: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Obesity Surgery, 33, 6, pp. 1730-1745, (2023); Kwong, Wilson, Maternal and neonatal outcomes after bariatric surgery; a systematic review and meta-analysis: do the benefits outweigh the risks?, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 218, 6, pp. 573-580, (2018); Falcone, Veronica, Pregnancy after bariatric surgery: A narrative literature review and discussion of impact on pregnancy management and outcome, BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, 18, 1, (2018); Gascoin, Géraldine, Risk of low birth weight and micronutrient deficiencies in neonates from mothers after gastric bypass: a case control study, Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, 13, 8, pp. 1384-1391, (2017); Sweet, Linda P., Women's experiences of pregnancy and lactation after bariatric surgery: A scoping review, Midwifery, 110, (2022); Eisenberg, Dan L., 2022 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO): Indications for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, 18, 12, pp. 1345-1356, (2022); Polskie Rekomendacje W Zakresie Chirurgii Bariatrycznej I Metabolicznej, (2025); Jiang, Mingjun, Association between breastfeeding duration and postpartum weight retention of lactating mothers: A meta-analysis of cohort studies, Clinical Nutrition, 37, 4, pp. 1224-1231, (2018)","","Springer","","","","","","09608923; 17080428","","OBSUE","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105015470579"

Methods: This open-label, non-randomised, observational study was conducted in patients aged 18 years and above, clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 after June 2021, and those residing within Greater Western Sydney. The study involved two arms: the remote monitoring (intervention) and standard care (control) groups. The intervention group comprised patients who were provided with an S-Patch EX to monitor their electrocardiogram. Data were transmitted in real-time to a mobile phone via Bluetooth technology, and results were generated through artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. All the data were reviewed for arrhythmia detection and escalated to the participant’s general practitioner (if detected) to determine the appropriate intervention. The control group was used to compare the rate of cardiac arrhythmia detection against the intervention group. The patient’s demographic and longitudinal clinical data were obtained from the electronic medical record system, enabling exploration and comparison of the cohort’s characteristics and outcomes. Descriptive analysis was conducted for categorical variables (frequencies and cross-tabulations) and continuous variables (means, standard deviations, and medians). Depending on the nature of data, the groups were compared using t-tests or Chi-square tests. Multivariable Cox regression was used to analyse time to first cardiovascular event post-COVID-19 infection. Outcome measures: The time to the patient’s first cardiovascular event (mainly arrhythmias) post-COVID-19 infection. Results: Of 44 patients who provided consent, 40 commenced monitoring. Thirteen patients (32.5%) were detected by the AI algorithms from the S-Patch EX monitoring system to have cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. Univariate Cox regression demonstrated that arrhythmia was more likely to be detected in the remote monitoring group (13/40, 32.9%) as compared with the standard care group (7/200, 3.5%) [HR = 29.56 (9.95, 87.86), p < 0.0001]. Most of the patients were detected with arrhythmia within a 3-month timeframe of monitoring. Twenty-one patients (21/200, 10.5%) from the standard care group visited the emergency department and/or were admitted to the hospital post-COVID-19 infection due to chest pain, shortness of breath/dyspnoea, palpitations, dizziness/light-headedness/presyncope, and nausea. Two patients developed long COVID symptoms (progressive dyspnoea) 2–5 months post-COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: Considering the risk of developing cardiovascular complications post-COVID-19 infection, regular monitoring, reassessment, and evaluation are recommended as a part of post-COVID-19 management for all patients, including young, healthy, and asymptomatic populations. A randomised interventional study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period is advised for a better understanding of the cardiovascular impact post-COVID infection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","arrhythmia; COVID survivors; long COVID; model of care; post-COVID clinical symptom; virtual monitoring","","","","","Fernández De Las Peñas, César, Post-COVID-19 Symptoms 2 Years After SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Hospitalized vs Nonhospitalized Patients, JAMA Network Open, 5, 11, (2022); Sidik, Saima May, Heart disease after COVID: what the data say, Nature, 608, 7921, pp. 26-28, (2022); Xie, Yan, Long-term cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19, Nature Medicine, 28, 3, pp. 583-590, (2022); Wang, Weijie, Long-term cardiovascular outcomes in COVID-19 survivors among non-vaccinated population: A retrospective cohort study from the TriNetX US collaborative networks, eClinicalMedicine, 53, (2022); Kole, Christo, Acute and Post-Acute COVID-19 Cardiovascular Complications: A Comprehensive Review, Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy, 38, 5, pp. 1017-1032, (2024); BMJ Yale, (2023); Sun, Mingyao, Increased risk of new-onset cardiovascular disease after COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 cohorts, Reviews in Medical Virology, 34, 2, (2024); DeVries, Andrea R., One-Year Adverse Outcomes among US Adults with Post-COVID-19 Condition vs Those Without COVID-19 in a Large Commercial Insurance Database, JAMA Health Forum, 4, 3, (2023); Chen, Chen, Global Prevalence of Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Condition or Long COVID: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review, Journal of Infectious Diseases, 226, 9, pp. 1593-1607, (2022); Long Covid in Australiaa Review of the Literature Catalogue Number Phe 318 Aihw Australian Government, (2022)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","26733129","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012756711"

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, United States, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, United States","Background: Females with irregular or unpredictable cycles, including those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), have limited options for validated at-home ovulation prediction. The majority of over-the-counter ovulation prediction kits use urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) indicators that were optimized for those with regular menstrual cycles exhibiting a predictable mid-cycle LH surge. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds potential to address this health deficit via a smartphone-based salivary ferning ovulation test. Research on populations with irregular menstruation and PCOS can be challenging due to the duration and frequency of menstrual cycles. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility for participants with diverse menstrual cycle lengths to complete study tasks designed to train and develop a potential future AI model for salivary ferning–based ovulation prediction. Methods: Participants were recruited for 2 menstrual cycles where retention, engagement, and adherence were evaluated. Participation entailed remotely collecting and uploading daily data (saliva, LH values), attending lab visits, and returning biological saliva samples. Results: Of the 133 females recruited from February to October 2023 via targeted patient messages and a public research website, 69 (51.9%) were eligible (age 19-35 years at enrollment, currently menstruating, able to read and comprehend English, weigh more than 110 lb, have an active primary care or gynecological provider, and able to commute to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) main campus within 10 days of their ovulatory event). Of the 43 (62.3%) eligible participants who consented and completed the baseline survey, the majority were White (n=24, 55.8%), employed (n=33, 76.7%), and highly educated (college or more; n=32, 74.4%) and had a mean BMI of 28.9 (SD 7.8) kg/m2. Of those who received a study kit (n=29, 42%), 17 (58.6%) participants began data collection, 9 (31%) provided data for completed study tasks for 1 menstrual cycle, and 7 (24.1%) completed the study. Furthermore, 19 (44.2%) eligible participants who completed the baseline survey withdrew from the study, citing menstrual cycles being too irregular for the study timeline (n=5, 26.3%), becoming pregnant (n=4, 21.1%), moving outside the study area (n=4, 21.1%), no time to dedicate to the study (n=2, 10.5%), ineligibility (n=2, 10.5%), and stress related to observing anovulation (n=2, 10.5%). Conclusions: To optimize future scaled participant completion, the study design would include a more targeted recruitment message to address the high ineligibility status, streamline study procedures to ease the participant burden, and incorporate health education to equip participants with ovulatory health information to ameliorate the potential stress impacts of observing anovulation. After optimization, when scaled, this study design could provide an AI model with sufficient data to develop a smartphone-based ovulation predictor specifically tested on females with irregular or unpredictable cycles, including those with PCOS.

The relationship between COVID-19 infection and BP remains unclear, as does the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on its incidence. This study aims to assess the occurrence of BP before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore any potential effects of COVID-19 vaccination on BP cases. Methods: This study utilized data from the TriNetX global health research network, specifically the US Collaborative Network of 68 healthcare organizations, encompassing 99,852,106 patients with ICD codes from 2016 to 2024. BP cases were identified using ICD-10 code G51.0, while COVID-19 vaccinations and infections were identified using CPT codes and TNX Curated 9088, respectively. We conducted an incidence and prevalence analysis of BP cases annually over the 8-year period to detect trends and compared BP rates between prepandemic (2016–2020) and postpandemic (2020–2024) periods using odds ratios. Additionally, we assessed BP incidence among COVID-19 patients and performed a subgroup analysis on vaccinated individuals to evaluate the impact of vaccination on BP incidence. To reduce potential confounding, we employed propensity score matching using the greedy nearest neighbor method available in the TriNetX platform, matching patients on age, sex, race, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and vascular commodities. Statistical analyses were executed within the TriNetX platform and supplemented by online AI tools using Python. Results: The analysis of BP cases from 2016 to 2024 revealed an upward trend in both incidence and prevalence. The incidence proportion rose from 48 cases per 100,000 people in 2016–2017 to 69 cases per 100,000 by 2023–2024, with a significant increase noted from 2021 onwards. Similarly, the incidence rate increased from 0.00000155 to 0.00000333 over the same period. Prevalence also showed a steady rise, from 228 to 434 cases per 100,000 people. Trend analyses confirmed these increases as statistically significant, with p-values indicating upward trends in incidence and prevalence. Comparing prepandemic (2016–2020) to postpandemic (2020–2024) periods, there was a significant rise in incidence proportions (p-value ≈ 0.0074) and prevalence rates (p-value = 0.0180). Among COVID-positive patients, the incidence proportion remained stable, while prevalence increased, indicating a higher burden compared to the general population. After propensity score matching, vaccinated individuals exhibited a significantly lower risk of BP compared to unvaccinated individuals (hazard ratio: 0.723, 95% CI: 0.618–0.84, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This highlights a significant increase in the incidence and prevalence of BP during the COVID-19 pandemic years compared to prepandemic levels. While the incidence of BP among vaccinated individuals showed a gradual increase, when mitigating for confounding influences using propensity score-matched analyses, it is revealed that these rates remained significantly lower than in unvaccinated populations, indicating a potentially protective association with vaccination. Changes in lifestyle, stress, and distribution of environmental viral loads and potentials during the pandemic may have contributed to a higher susceptibility to BP in the general population. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bell’s palsy; COVID vaccination; COVID-19 pandemic","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; Bell palsy; child; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; female; human; incidence; male; middle aged; prevalence; prevention and control; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bell Palsy; Child; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Young Adult","","COVID-19 Vaccines","","J Neurol, (2023); Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, (2022); Health Psychol, (2023); J Med Internet Res, (2022); Soltanzadi, Atena, Incidence of Bell's palsy after coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination: a systematic review and meta-analysis, Neurologia, 39, 9, pp. 802-809, (2024); van der Boom, Meiwen D.X., Observed-over-Expected analysis as additional method for pharmacovigilance signal detection in large-scaled spontaneous adverse event reporting, Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, 32, 7, pp. 783-794, (2023); Lancet Reg Health Eur, (2021); Vaccine, (2023); Can J Neurol Sci, (2024); BMJ, (2022)","","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","","","","","","15317129; 15374505","","ONTEA","40690195","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011613292"

However, hypertension is mainly preventable, highlighting the need for effective prevention strategies to mitigate this critical health concern. This scoping review aimed to identify existing knowledge gaps and provide a comprehensive understanding of hypertension prevention interventions. Keywords were identified, and an unrestricted search for empirical studies was conducted until December 20, 2024. The search strategy encompassed 11 databases. Ultimately, studies focusing on preventive interventions targeting the Thai population at risk of hypertension were included in this review. Finally, we included 41 studies: 35 in community settings, two in hospital clinics, and four in Buddhist temples. The total number of participants was 16,401, ranging from 32 to 4,786, aged between 18 and 74. Research designs comprised 32 quasi-experimental studies, seven randomized controlled trials, one action research, and one research and development. Researchers primarily delivered interventions. The interventions focused on hypertension monitoring, knowledge promotion, health behavior modification, social support, and counseling, emphasizing preventive behaviors, nutrition promotion, and disease awareness. Researchers commonly took outcome measurements before and 12 weeks after intervention. Manuals, logbooks, and lectures with presentation slides were the primary platforms. Finally, knowledge, behaviors, and biomarkers were the most frequently assessed outcomes. This scoping review provided recommendations that future research should expand intervention strategies, emphasize biomarkers, adopt modern delivery methods like AI chatbots and mobile apps, and include follow-ups beyond 12 weeks to ensure lasting impact. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hypertension; intervention; review; self-care; self-management; self-monitoring","biological marker; awareness; behavior; counseling; follow up; human; hypertension; knowledge; mortality; obesity; outcome assessment; Review; self care; self monitoring; social support; systematic review; adolescent; adult; aged; attitude to health; blood pressure; diagnosis; epidemiology; female; health promotion; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; prevention and control; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; Southeast Asian; Thailand; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; Self Care; Southeast Asian People; Young Adult","","","We sincerely appreciate everyone who contributed to this study, with special recognition to the Librarian for their meticulous and comprehensive search efforts.

Research on effective, culturally-centered, multi-level approaches to prevent suicide in AI/AN populations are limited. Methods: This multi-site longitudinal evaluation employed a retrospective pre-posttest design, utilizing a self-report survey administered daily following the training. Daily surveys included four areas related to suicide prevention, holistic wellness, generational knowledge, behavior change, and legacy impacts. The first objective of this study was to explore how the Good Road of Life training impacted participant knowledge regarding suicide and related risk factors while also exploring protective behaviors and impacts from a culturally-centered, strengths-based lens. A second objective was to present a conceptual model grounded in socioecological and trans-ecological theories of GRL for collective healing targeting the individual, family, community, Tribe, and nation to prevent suicide. Results: Between 2019 and 2024, 27 GRL trainings were conducted at 8 Tribal sites in Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Data accumulated across these 27 trainings and 1,810 students represented diverse tribes, locations, and ages. Students were asked to rate different domains of Holistic Wellness: mental (M = 3.25, SD = 1.03), physical (M = 3.33, SD = 1.03), spiritual (M = 3.35, SD = 1.05), and emotional (M = 3.17, SD = 1.12). Students rated 17 generational knowledge domains before and after GRL training; all comparisons were significant at p < 0.001; all differences had moderate or large effect sizes. Middle school students reported larger increases in knowledge from pre to post than high school students. Discussion: Findings from this evaluation underscore the importance of early intervention, culturally-centered approaches, and community-led suicide prevention in AI/AN populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian / Alaska Native; American Indian youth; cultural intervention; gatekeeper training; suicide prevention","adolescent; American Indian; attitude to health; ethnology; female; human; longitudinal study; male; psychology; retrospective study; suicide; suicide prevention; United States; young adult; Adolescent; American Indian or Alaska Native; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indians, North American; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Retrospective Studies; Suicide; Suicide Prevention; Young Adult","","","","Cheyenne Cultural Kinship Systems Boys and Girls Club Northern Cheyenne Nation, (2001); Parker, Tassy, American Indian and Alaska Native Life Expectancy: Writing a New Narrative, JAMA, 330, 21, pp. 2053-2054, (2023); International Handbook of Multigenerational Legacies of Trauma, (1998); Inj Prev, (2022); Curtin, Sally C., Deaths: Leading Causes for 2021, National Vital Statistics Reports, 73, 4, pp. 1-17, (2024); Price, James H., Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in American Indian and Alaska Native Adolescents, Journal of Community Health, 50, 2, pp. 227-234, (2025); Schuler, Adrienne, Suicidality by Sexual Identity and Correlates Among American Indian and Alaska Native High School Students, Journal of Adolescent Health, 73, 6, pp. 1030-1037, (2023); Rey, Little Dove F., A Systematic Review of Research Methodologies in American Indian and Alaska Native Suicide Research From 2010 to 2020, Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 29, 3, pp. 358-371, (2022); Suicide Clusters within American Indian and Alaska Native Communities A Review of the Literature and Recommendations, (2017); Hirsch, Jameson K., Forgiveness, depression, and suicidal behavior among a diverse sample of college students, Journal of Clinical Psychology, 67, 9, pp. 896-906, (2011)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","22962565","","","40662099","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010913571"

With rising healthcare costs and aging populations, proactive health management becomes increasingly important. Age-shifted photos, enabled by advances in computer vision and AI, offer a novel approach to encourage healthier choices by visualizing one’s future or past self. Through semi-structured interviews, 120 participants aged 28–84 years were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, aged-progressed (young-to-old), and age-regressed (old-to-young) photos. Thematic analysis of interview data revealed distinct patterns in health management intentions across groups. Participants exposed to age-progressed photos emphasized mental health and lifestyle adaptations for aging, while those shown age-regressed photos focused on preventive measures to maintain independence. Interestingly, all groups expressed a strong interest in travel, suggesting a universal desire for engagement across age and health orientations. These findings demonstrate the potential of age-shifted photos as a technological intervention for promoting proactive health behaviors, though effectiveness varied, underscoring the importance of personalized approaches. Future implementations should address ethical considerations, assess long-term efficacy, integrate complementary techniques, and adapt to diverse cultural contexts to ensure responsible, impactful health promotion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age-shifted photos; Health management; Health promotion; Independence; Mental health; Technological intervention","Accelerated aging; Geriatrics; Health care; Age groups; Age-shifted photo; Aging population; Different ages; Health care costs; Health management; Health promotion; Independence; Mental health; Technological intervention; Information management","","","This study was conducted as part of the AGELESS research program, funded by the Ministry of Higher Education under the Long Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS/1/2019/UM/01/1/1, LR005-2019, GOV-000047).

However, patient acceptance of AI-assisted diagnosis, compared with human-only procedures, remains understudied, especially in the wake of generative AI advancements such as ChatGPT. Objective: This research examines patient preferences for doctors using AI assistance versus those relying solely on human expertise. It also studies demographic, social, and experiential factors influencing these preferences. Methods: We conducted a preregistered 4-group randomized survey experiment among a national sample representative of the US population on several demographic benchmarks (n=1762). Participants viewed identical doctor profiles, with varying AI usage descriptions: no AI mention (control, n=421), explicit nonuse (No AI, n=435), moderate use (Moderate AI, n=481), and extensive use (Extensive AI, n=425). Respondents reported their tendency to seek help, trust in the doctor as a person and a professional, knowledge of AI, frequency of using AI in their daily lives, demographics, and partisan identification. We analyzed the results with ordinary least squares regression (controlling for sociodemographic factors), mediation analysis, and moderation analysis. We also explored the moderating effect of past AI experiences on the tendency to seek help and trust in the doctor. Results: Mentioning that the doctor uses AI to assist in diagnosis consistently decreased trust and intention to seek help. Trust and intention to seek help (measured with a 5-point Likert scale and coded as 0‐1 with equal intervals in between) were highest when AI was explicitly absent (control group: mean 0.50; No AI group: mean 0.63) and lowest when AI was extensively used (Extensive AI group: mean 0.30; Moderate AI group: mean 0.34). A linear regression controlling for demographics suggested that the negative effect of AI assistance was significant with a large effect size (β=−.45, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.40, t<inf>1740</inf>=−20.81; P<.001). This pattern was consistent for trust in the doctor as a person (β=−.33, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.28, t<inf>1733</inf>=−14.41; P<.001) and as a professional (β=−.40, 95% CI −0.45 to −0.36, t<inf>1735</inf>=−18.54; P<.001). Results were consistent across age, gender, education, and partisanship, indicating a broad aversion to AI-assisted diagnosis. Moderation analyses suggested that the “AI trust gap” shrank as AI use frequency increased (interaction term: β=.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.13, t<inf>1735</inf>=4.06; P<.001) but expanded as self-reported knowledge increased (interaction term: β=−.04, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.00, t<inf>1736</inf>=−1.75; P=.08). Conclusions: Despite AI’s growing role in medicine, patients still prefer human-only expertise, regardless of partisanship and demographics, underscoring the need for strategies to build trust in AI technologies in health care. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI aversion; AI-assisted diagnosis; generative AI; patient acceptance; survey experiment","adult; aged; Article; artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis; attitude to health; ChatGPT; controlled study; demographics; educational status; female; health care survey; help seeking behavior; Hispanic; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; mediation analysis; middle aged; patient preference; physician; social aspect; trust; web-based intervention; artificial intelligence; behavior; doctor patient relationship; health care personnel; Internet; patient attitude; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; United States; young adult; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Physician-Patient Relations; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust; Young Adult","","","","Benjamens, Stan, The state of artificial intelligence-based FDA-approved medical devices and algorithms: an online database, npj Digital Medicine, 3, 1, (2020); Young, Albert T., Patient and general public attitudes towards clinical artificial intelligence: a mixed methods systematic review, The Lancet Digital Health, 3, 9, pp. e599-e611, (2021); Nejm AI, (2023); Longoni, Chiara, Resistance to Medical Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Consumer Research, 46, 4, pp. 629-650, (2019); Mello, Michelle Marie, Understanding Liability Risk from Using Health Care Artificial Intelligence Tools, New England Journal of Medicine, 390, 3, pp. 271-278, (2024); Alowais, Shuroug A., Revolutionizing healthcare: the role of artificial intelligence in clinical practice, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023); Nelson, Caroline A., Patient Perspectives on the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Skin Cancer Screening: A Qualitative Study, JAMA Dermatology, 156, 5, pp. 501-512, (2020); Beets, Becca, Surveying Public Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care in the United States: Systematic Review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, (2023); Jutzi, Tanja B., Artificial Intelligence in Skin Cancer Diagnostics: The Patients' Perspective, Frontiers in Medicine, 7, (2020); Palmisciano, Paolo, Attitudes of Patients and Their Relatives Toward Artificial Intelligence in Neurosurgery, World Neurosurgery, 138, pp. e627-e633, (2020)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","14388871","","","40532180","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008433920"

However, there is a lack of clarity regarding the prevalence of its application, as well as the dimensions and mechanisms of personalization within DMHIs for adolescents and youth. Methods: To understand how personalization has been applied in DMHIs for adolescents and young people, a scoping review was conducted. Empirical studies on DMHIs for adolescents and youth with depression and anxiety, published between 2013 and July 2024, were extracted from PubMed and Scopus. A total of 67 studies were included in the review. Additionally, we expanded an existing personalization framework, which originally classified personalization into four dimensions (content, order, guidance, and communication) and four mechanisms (user choice, provider choice, rule-based, and machine learning), by incorporating non-therapeutic elements. Results: The adapted framework includes therapeutic and non-therapeutic content, order, guidance, therapeutic and non-therapeutic communication, interfaces (customization of non-therapeutic visual or interactive components), and interactivity (personalization of user preferences), while retaining the original mechanisms. Half of the interventions studied used only one personalization dimension (51%), and more than two-thirds used only one personalization mechanism. This review found that personalization of therapeutic content (51% of the interventions) and interfaces (25%) were favored. User choice was the most prevalent personalization mechanism, present in 60% of interventions. Additionally, machine learning mechanisms were employed in a substantial number of cases (30%), but there were no instances of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among the included studies. Discussion: The findings of the review suggest that although personalization elements of the interventions are reported in the articles, their impact on younger people's experience with DMHIs and adherence to mental health protocols is not thoroughly addressed. Future interventions may benefit from incorporating generative AI, while adhering to standard clinical research practices, to further personalize user experiences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adherence; adolescents; anxiety; depression; digital mental health interventions; personalisation; youth","adolescent; anxiety; artificial intelligence; computerized adaptive testing; conceptual framework; depression; dialectical behavior therapy; digital mental health intervention; ecological momentary assessment; emotion; exercise; gamification; help seeking behavior; human; large language model; machine learning; mental disease; mental health; mental health care personnel; mindfulness; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; personality; psychiatric treatment; psychoeducation; psychology; qualitative research; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; scoping review; self report questionnaire; semi structured interview; Social Cognitive Theory; suicidal behavior","","","The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI (Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot’s impact on eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all types of eating disorders. Methods: This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group (n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology (primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention group only. Results: ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in participants’ confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The chatbot was rated as “excellent” in terms of usability. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30). Conclusions: ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; artificial intelligence; chatbot; cognitive behavioral therapy; conversational agent; digital health; eating disorder; enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy; mental health; randomized controlled trial; single-session intervention","adolescent; adult; anorexia nervosa; anxiety; Article; Australia; avoidant restrictive food intake disorder; binge eating disorder; bulimia; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental stress; motivation; multicenter study; outcome assessment; parallel design; psychoeducation; randomized controlled trial; single session intervention; social psychology; usability; web-based intervention; clinical trial; generative artificial intelligence; hospital admission; middle aged; psychology; therapy; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Female; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Waiting Lists; Young Adult","","","","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (2022); Hay, Phillipa J., Epidemiology of eating disorders: population, prevalence, disease burden and quality of life informing public policy in Australia—a rapid review, Journal of Eating Disorders, 11, 1, (2023); Allen, Karina L., A framework for conceptualising early intervention for eating disorders, European Eating Disorders Review, 31, 2, pp. 320-334, (2023); Sukunesan, Suku, Examining the pro-eating disorders community on twitter via the hashtag #proana: Statistical modeling approach, JMIR Mental Health, 8, 7, (2021); Treasure, Janet L., The case for early intervention in anorexia nervosa: Theoretical exploration of maintaining factors, British Journal of Psychiatry, 199, 1, pp. 5-7, (2011); Arcelus, Jon, Mortality rates in patients with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders: A meta-analysis of 36 studies, Archives of General Psychiatry, 68, 7, pp. 724-731, (2011); Austin, Amelia, Duration of untreated eating disorder and relationship to outcomes: A systematic review of the literature, European Eating Disorders Review, 29, 3, pp. 329-345, (2021); Fairburn, Christopher G., Eating disorders, The Lancet, 361, 9355, pp. 407-416, (2003); Treasure, Janet L., Eating disorders, The Lancet, 395, 10227, pp. 899-911, (2020); Byrne, Susan M., The effectiveness of enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders: An open trial, Behaviour Research and Therapy, 49, 4, pp. 219-226, (2011)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","14388871","","","40397933","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006454493"

This study explores the socio-ecological drivers of anthrax transmission and examines the role of legal and illegal wildlife trade value chains in sustaining outbreaks. Secondly, the study explores the methodology used to investigate community knowledge, perceptions, and the impacts of anthrax through focus group discussions (FGDs) and a hybrid approach combining traditional thematic analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The research was framed within the interpretivist paradigm, aiming to understand shared experiences and socio-cultural contexts. The study utilized focus groups to encourage interaction and generate rich, collective insights. The hybrid approach allowed for data analysis that combined researcher-led reflexivity with AI-driven thematic analysis. Findings reveal diverse levels of awareness about anthrax, widespread misconceptions, and the influence of cultural beliefs on health behaviours. Communities linked anthrax outbreaks to interactions with wildlife and the illegal game meat trade, highlighting the complex interplay of ecological, economic, and behavioural factors in disease dynamics. Additionally, the study underscores the socioeconomic toll of anthrax, including livestock losses, disrupted livelihoods, and food insecurity, compounded by inadequate public health and veterinary responses. The insights gained from this research emphasize the need for multi-sectoral interventions tailored to the specific needs of these communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; agricultural worker; anthrax; Article; artificial intelligence; awareness; community; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; female; food insecurity; game; game management; health behavior; human; illegal wildlife trade; interview; knowledge; male; perception; public health; qualitative research; questionnaire; ruminant; stakeholder engagement; thematic analysis; wild meat; wildlife; Zambia; zoonosis; animal; attitude to health; epidemiology; information processing; microbiology; middle aged; psychology; veterinary medicine; wild animal; young adult; Adult; Animals; Animals, Wild; Anthrax; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Young Adult; Zoonoses","","","The authors are grateful to staff members of the Department of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries in Monze, Kazungula and Mumba District for facilitating data collection.

While these platforms have provided avenues for free expression and connection, they have also accelerated the dissemination of hate speech and contributed to the prevalence of cyberbullying. Hate speech involves the use of insulting language based on preconceived notions and stereotypes, while cyberbullying entails purposeful and repeated harm inflicted on individuals online. Hate Speech in the name of freedom of Speech has its own repercussions, for example, when a politician made comments on religious beliefs, social media acted as a medium of hate propagation. Hate and violent remarks like these are making social media a hostile place. These global issues have garnered attention from nations and organizations, as they not only impact adults but also put young children at risk of online crimes and trolling. The detrimental effects include anxiety, low self-esteem, and stress while fostering a culture of intolerance and toxicity. With a significant proportion of individuals experiencing cyberbullying, the detection and mitigation of hate speech and cyberbullying require automated approaches. Various detection techniques, along with deep learning and machine learning models, are explored in this chapter. The chapter also discusses the impact of cyberbullying and hate speech on mental health, highlights state-of-the-art models for detection, and presents research challenges and future directions in the field. This chapter explores the critical role of AI-driven techniques in detecting and addressing cyberbullying and hate speech, which are increasingly prevalent threats within digital knowledge-sharing platforms. By examining the impact of such harmful content on online knowledge environments, the chapter highlights how cybersecurity measures can protect the integrity of knowledge systems, enabling safer and more inclusive digital spaces. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Artificial life; Intelligent computing; Intelligent systems; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge transfer; Artificial intelligence techniques; Automated approach; Cyber bullying; Freedom of speech; Global issues; Self esteem; Self-stresses; Social media; Social-networking; Young children; Deep learning","","","","Albadi, Nuha, Are they our brothers? analysis and detection of religious hate speech in the Arabic Twittersphere, pp. 69-76, (2018); Bbc News, (2021); Bender, Emily M., On the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?, pp. 610-623, (2021); All the Latest Cyberbullying Statistics for 2023, (2023); Cheng, Lu, XBully: Cyberbullying detection within a multi-modal context, pp. 339-347, (2019); Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online, (2019); Davidson, Thomas R., Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language, pp. 512-515, (2017); Npr, (2021); Reddit A New Harassment Filter and User Reporting Type, (2024); Youtube Our Approach to Responsible AI Innovation, (2023)","","CRC Press","","","","","","","9781032802312; 9781040358344","","","English","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005039644"

For premenopausal women, ovarian function suppression (OFS) in combination with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) is utilised in high-risk cases. The resultant suppression of circulating oestradiol from OFS could have adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects, subsequently increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Material and methods: A systematic search of online databases was conducted to identify randomised control trials involving OFS which reported cardiovascular and metabolic adverse events. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. Results: Four studies with a total of 7808 participants were included in the analysis. Tamoxifen alone carries a lower risk of hypertension compared with tamoxifen plus OFS (4.81% vs. 7.57%, OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49–0.91; p = 0.01). The tamoxifen alone group showed a lower risk of hyperglycaemia compared to tamoxifen with OFS (0.10% vs. 0.86%, OR = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02–0.85, p = 0.03). Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential cardio-metabolic impact of endocrine therapy and OFS on premenopausal women with BC. It also highlights the pressing need for standardisation of routine collection and recording of cardiometabolic history and risk factors as part of baseline assessment and adverse event reporting to better understand the cardiometabolic impact these treatments have on our patients. Further studies, with particular focus on baseline and subsequent development of cardiovascular risk factors, are needed to explore the impact of these drugs on the cardiovascular health of young women with BC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","aromatase inhibitor; breast cancer; cardiometabolic; ovarian suppression; tamoxifen","anastrozole; aromatase inhibitor; exemestane; gonadorelin derivative; tamoxifen; zoledronic acid; adverse outcome; Article; body weight gain; drug efficacy; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; follow up; glucose intolerance; heart muscle ischemia; hormonal therapy; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; meta analysis; odds ratio; oophorectomy; ovary function; ovulation inhibition; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); regression analysis; risk factor; side effect; systematic review; thrombosis","","anastrozole, 120511-73-1; exemestane, 107868-30-4; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; zoledronic acid, 118072-93-8, 131654-46-1, 165800-06-6, 165800-07-7","","Lumachi, Franco, Treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, Current Medicinal Chemistry, 20, 5, pp. 596-604, (2013); Paluch–Shimon, Shani, ESO–ESMO 4th International Consensus Guidelines for Breast Cancer in Young Women (BCY4), Annals of Oncology, 31, 6, pp. 674-696, (2020); Bradley, Rosie, Aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen in premenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer treated with ovarian suppression: a patient-level meta-analysis of 7030 women from four randomised trials, The Lancet Oncology, 23, 3, pp. 382-392, (2022); Patnaik, Jennifer Landrigan, Cardiovascular disease competes with breast cancer as the leading cause of death for older females diagnosed with breast cancer: A retrospective cohort study, Breast Cancer Research, 13, 3, (2011); Matthews, Anthony A., Long term adjuvant endocrine therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease in female breast cancer survivors: Systematic review, BMJ, 363, (2018); Mendelsohn, Michael E., The protective effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular system, New England Journal of Medicine, 340, 23, pp. 1801-1811, (1999); Martins, David S., The effect of gender on age-related blood pressure changes and the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension among older adults: Data from NHANES III, Journal of Gender-Specific Medicine, 4, 3, pp. 10-20, (2001); Yang, Geniey, Toxicity and adverse effects of Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 139, 3, pp. 392-404, (2013); Sterne, Jonathan A.C., RoB 2: A revised tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials, BMJ, 366, (2019); Tevaarwerk, Amye J., Phase III comparison of tamoxifen versus tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression in premenopausal women with node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (E-3193, INT-0142): A trial of the eastern cooperative oncology group, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 32, 35, pp. 3948-3958, (2014)","","Termedia Publishing House Ltd.","","","","","","18969151; 17341922","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004075610"

However, existing studies have mostly focused on the accuracy of depression recognition, ignoring the association between features and models. Additionally, there is a lack of research on the contribution of different features to depression recognition. To this end, this study introduces an innovative approach to depression detection using EEG data, integrating Ant-Lion Optimization (ALO) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for feature fusion analysis. The inclusion of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods enhances the explainability of the model’s features. The Time-Delay Embedded Hidden Markov Model (TDE-HMM) is employed to infer internal brain states during depression, triggered by audio stimulation. The ALO-MARL algorithm, combined with hyper-parameter optimization of the XGBoost classifier, achieves high accuracy (93.69%), sensitivity (88.60%), specificity (97.08%), and F1-score (91.82%) on a auditory stimulus-evoked three-channel EEG dataset. The results suggest that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection methods for depression recognition on this dataset, and XAI elucidates the critical impact of the minimum value of Power Spectral Density (PSD), Sample Entropy (SampEn), and Rényi Entropy (Ren) on depression recognition. The study also explores dynamic brain state transitions revealed by audio stimuli, providing insights for the clinical application of AI algorithms in depression recognition. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ant lion optimization - multi-agent reinforcement learning (ALO-MARL); depression detection; EEG; explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)","Feature Selection; Reinforcement learning; Affective Computing; Ant lion optimization - multi-agent reinforcement learning; Artificial intelligence technologies; Brain state; Depression detection; Detection methods; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Features selection; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Optimisations; Hidden Markov models; accuracy; adolescent; adult; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; auditory stimulation; computer model; controlled study; depression; discrete wavelet transform; dynamics; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; entropy; explainable artificial intelligence; feature selection; hidden Markov model; human; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; machine learning; major clinical study; mastoid; model; neurophysiology; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; power spectrum; psychiatrist; reinforcement learning (machine learning); sensitivity and specificity; Shapley additive explanation; support vector machine; classification; diagnosis; female; male; Markov chain; pathophysiology; procedures; reinforcement (psychology); young adult; Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Depression; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Markov Chains; Reinforcement, Psychology; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62227807, Grant 62402041, Grant 12374171, Grant 62072219, Grant 61802159, and Grant 62272044; in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People\u2019s Republic of China with the STI2030-Major Projects under Grant 2021ZD0201900, Grant 2021ZD0200408, and Grant 2021ZD0200601; in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2023YFC2506804, Grant 2019YFA0706200, and Grant 2022YFC3500503; and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.","Cai, Hanshu, A multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder analysis, Scientific Data, 9, 1, (2022); Depression and Other Common Mental Disorders Global Health Estimates, (2017); Tian, Fuze, The Three-Lead EEG Sensor: Introducing an EEG-Assisted Depression Diagnosis System Based on Ant Lion Optimization, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 17, 6, pp. 1305-1318, (2023); Chennapragada, Lakshmi, International PRISMA scoping review to understand mental health interventions for depression in COVID-19 patients, Psychiatry Research, 316, (2022); Frøkjaer, Jens Brondum, Integrity of central nervous function in diabetes mellitus assessed by resting state EEG frequency analysis and source localization, Journal of Diabetes and its Complications, 31, 2, pp. 400-406, (2017); Li, Xiaowei, A study on EEG-based brain electrical source of mild depressed subjects, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 120, 3, pp. 135-141, (2015); Cai, Hanshu, A Case-Based Reasoning Model for Depression Based on Three-Electrode EEG Data, IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 11, 3, pp. 383-392, (2020); Wang, Baiyang, Depression signal correlation identification from different EEG channels based on CNN feature extraction, Psychiatry Research - Neuroimaging, 328, (2023); Hu, Bin, Physiological Electrosignal Asynchronous Acquisition Technology: Insight and Perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, 11, 1, pp. 5-24, (2024); Shen, Lin, A First Look at Generative Artificial Intelligence Based Music Therapy for Mental Disorders, IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15580210; 15344320","","ITNSB","40173060","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002609894"

Understanding the factors that influence attitudes toward AI is crucial for effective adoption. Despite AI’s growing integration into health care, consumer and patient acceptance remains a critical challenge. Research has largely focused on applications or attitudes, lacking a comprehensive analysis of how factors, such as demographics, personality traits, technology attitudes, and AI knowledge, affect and interact across different health care AI contexts. Objective: We aimed to investigate people’s trust in and acceptance of AI across health care use cases and determine how context and perceived risk affect individuals’ propensity to trust and accept AI in specific health care scenarios. Methods: We collected and analyzed web-based survey data from 1100 Finnish participants, presenting them with 8 AI use cases in health care: 5 (62%) noninvasive applications (eg, activity monitoring and mental health support) and 3 (38%) physical interventions (eg, AI-controlled robotic surgery). Respondents evaluated intention to use, trust, and willingness to trade off personal data for these use cases. Gradient boosted tree regression models were trained to predict responses based on 33 demographic-, personality-, and technology-related variables. To interpret the results of our predictive models, we used the Shapley additive explanations method, a game theory–based approach for explaining the output of machine learning models. It quantifies the contribution of each feature to individual predictions, allowing us to determine the relative importance of various demographic-, personality-, and technology-related factors and their interactions in shaping participants’ trust in and acceptance of AI in health care. Results: Consumer attitudes toward technology, technology use, and personality traits were the primary drivers of trust and intention to use AI in health care. Use cases were ranked by acceptance, with noninvasive monitors being the most preferred. However, the specific use case had less impact in general than expected. Nonlinear dependencies were observed, including an inverted U-shaped pattern in positivity toward AI based on self-reported AI knowledge. Certain personality traits, such as being more disorganized and careless, were associated with more positive attitudes toward AI in health care. Women seemed more cautious about AI applications in health care than men. Conclusions: The findings highlight the complex interplay of factors influencing trust and acceptance of AI in health care. Consumer trust and intention to use AI in health care are driven by technology attitudes and use rather than specific use cases. AI service providers should consider demographic factors, personality traits, and technology attitudes when designing and implementing AI systems in health care. The study demonstrates the potential of using predictive AI models as decision-making tools for implementing and interacting with clients in health care AI applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; artificial intelligence; health care technology; predictive modeling; technology adoption; user acceptance; user trust","Article; artificial intelligence; comparative study; conceptual framework; confirmatory factor analysis; consumer attitude; controlled study; demography; female; health care; health care utilization; health service; healthy lifestyle; human; human computer interaction; identifiable information; internal consistency; machine learning; male; menstrual cycle; mental health; multiple choice test; predictive model; questionnaire; robot assisted surgery; root mean squared error; self care; Shapley additive explanation; trust; wellbeing; adult; aged; Finland; health care delivery; middle aged; patient attitude; psychology; young adult; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust; Young Adult","","","This research was funded by \u201CAI Driver\u201D (decision number OKM/108/523/2021) and \u201CAI Forum\u201D (decision number OKM/116/523/2020) projects by Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture and \u201CEmotional experience of privacy and ethics in everyday pervasive systems [BUGGED]\u201D (decision number 348391) and \u201CMultifaceted ripple effects and limitations of AI-human interplay at work, business and society [SYNTHETICA]\u201D (decision number 358714) projects by Research Council of Finland.","Stoumpos, Angelos I., Digital Transformation in Healthcare: Technology Acceptance and Its Applications, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 20, 4, (2023); Asan, Onur, Artificial Intelligence and Human Trust in Healthcare: Focus on Clinicians, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22, 6, (2020); Singh, Rishi P., Current challenges and barriers to real-world artificial intelligence adoption for the healthcare system, provider, and the patient, Translational Vision Science and Technology, 9, 2, pp. 1-6, (2020); Chew, Han Shi Jocelyn, Perceptions and Needs of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care to Increase Adoption: Scoping Review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 24, 1, (2022); Al-Kuwaiti, Ahmed A., A Review of the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, Journal of Personalized Medicine, 13, 6, (2023); Saariluoma, Pertti O., Techno-trust and rational trust in technology – A conceptual investigation, IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology, 544, pp. 283-293, (2019); Robbins, Blaine G., Probing the Links Between Trustworthiness, Trust, and Emotion: Evidence From Four Survey Experiments, Social Psychology Quarterly, 79, 3, pp. 284-308, (2016); Holton, Richard, Deciding to Trust, Coming to Believe, Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 72, 1, pp. 63-76, (1994); Riedl, Reńe, Is trust in artificial intelligence systems related to user personality?

Most of the disease is because of the bacteria present inside the mouth, which is untreated, and it becomes tooth decay in most of the young children, gum problems for those who are above 30 years old and above 65 years old are affected by tooth loss. Other than these issues, the dental practitioners recommend humans to take care of their teeth and oral hygiene by the best practice methods like brushing twice a day, using flaws in the bacteria affected area by finding out using plaque disclosing agents like liquid solutions or pills. Improper oral hygiene leads to heart attacks, stroke, diabetics, bone issues, Alzheimer's problems and several other issues without indicating any tooth pain. Human judgement varies from person to person, and it is difficult to predict. Here different AI algorithms such as grey wolf optimizer algorithm in deep learning methods infused with generative AI are for improved treatment outcomes through the analysis of dataset comprising dental records and clinical information.

While conventional therapeutic interventions often follow structured protocols, the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to provide continuous conversational support remains unexplored. This study evaluates the feasibility and impact of AI chatbots in alleviating psychological distress and enhancing treatment engagement in this vulnerable population. Methods: Two age-appropriate AI chatbots, leveraging GPT-4, were developed to provide natural, empathetic conversations without structured therapeutic protocols. Five pediatric and AYA cancer patients participated in a two-week intervention, engaging with the chatbots via a messaging platform. Pre- and post-intervention anxiety and stress levels were self-reported, and usage patterns were analyzed to assess the chatbots’ effectiveness. Results: Four out of five participants reported significant reductions in anxiety and stress levels post-intervention. Participants engaged with the chatbot every 2–3 days, with sessions lasting approximately 10 min. All participants noted improved treatment motivation, with 80% disclosing personal concerns to the chatbot they had not shared with healthcare providers. The 24/7 availability particularly benefited patients experiencing nighttime anxiety. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates the potential of generative AI chatbots to complement traditional mental health services by addressing unmet psychological needs in pediatric and AYA cancer patients. The findings suggest these tools can serve as accessible, continuous support systems. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate these promising results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescent and young adult (AYA); generative AI chatbot; large language model; pediatric cancer; psychological support","adolescent; adult; anxiety; Article; artificial intelligence chatbot; bone tumor; child; distress syndrome; emotional stress; empathy; feedback system; female; health care personnel; human; large language model; male; malignant neoplasm; mental health; mental health service; motivation; natural language processing; patient care; perception; physiological stress; pilot study; psychological care; qualitative analysis; quality control; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; vulnerable population; young adult","","","The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Objectives: This review aims to explore the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in enhancing suicide risk prediction and developing effective prevention strategies, examining how these technologies integrate complex risk factors, including psychiatric, socio-economic, dietary, and environmental influences. Methods: A comprehensive review of literature from databases such as PubMed and Web of Science was conducted, focusing on studies that utilize AI and ML technologies. The review assessed the efficacy of various models, including Random Forest, neural networks, and others, in analyzing data from electronic health records, social media, and digital behaviors. Additionally, it evaluated a broad spectrum of dietary factors and their influence on suicidal behaviors, as well as the impact of environmental contaminants like lithium, arsenic, fluoride, mercury, and organophosphorus pesticides. Conclusions: AI and ML are revolutionizing suicide prevention strategies, with models achieving nearly 90 % predictive accuracy by integrating diverse data sources. Our findings highlight the need for geographically and demographically tailored public health interventions and comprehensive AI models that address the multifactorial nature of suicide risk. However, the deployment of these technologies must address critical ethical and privacy concerns, ensuring compliance with regulations and the development of transparent, ethically guided AI systems.

Methods: The cross-sectional survey designed to assess awareness, perceptions and opinions of HCs towards AI was conducted between April to June 2023. A pre-tested, validated structured questionnaire was distributed electronically to HCs across different universities in Saudi Arabia. Responses were compiled using a 5-point Likert scale. Cronbach's alpha score of 0.80 was used to establish the reliability of the questionnaire. Mean scores were determined by calculating each item in the perceptions compiled. Results: Majority of HCs had a positive perception towards AI in healthcare and agreed that AI could improve diagnostic accuracy (73.4 %), reduce errors in medical practice (65.2 %) and facilitate patient education (70.8 %). However, some concerns were expressed that AI has a harmful impact on healthcare practitioners' relationships with patients and potential ethical implications (44.3 %) and also allows patients to increase control over their health (51 %). Most students (85 %) believe that if AI is integrated into healthcare, there is a risk of losing jobs. The analysis of multiple linear regression shows that course of study (B = 0.311; SE = 0.132; t = 2.360; p = 0.019; CI = 0.052 to 0.570), awareness of AI (B = -1.822; SE = 0.785; t = -2.320; p = 0.021; CI = - 3.366 to -0.279) were predictors of perception score of AI. Conclusion: Healthcare students show positive perceptions towards AI and agree that AI helps in various aspects of healthcare. However, students revealed some concerns about AI. Therefore, addressing concerns related to ethics, workforce impact and patient privacy is crucial for successful AI implementation in the healthcare sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Awareness; Healthcare; Perceptions; Students","adult; Article; artificial intelligence; awareness; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; female; genetic risk; health care; health care cost; health care personnel; health center; health student; human; knowledge; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; medical practice; medication error; multiple linear regression analysis; patient education; perception; physiotherapy; questionnaire; Saudi Arabia; structured questionnaire; young adult","","","","Berwick, Donald M., The triple aim: Care, health, and cost, Health Affairs, 27, 3, pp. 759-769, (2008); Ahuja, Abhimanyu S., The impact of artificial intelligence in medicine on the future role of the physician, PeerJ, 2019, 10, (2019); Ahmed, Zaboor, Knowledge, attitude, and practice of artificial intelligence among doctors and medical students in Pakistan: A cross-sectional online survey, Annals of Medicine and Surgery, 76, (2022); Esteva, Andre, Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks, Nature, 542, 7639, pp. 115-118, (2017); Syed, Wajid, Assessment of Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial Intelligence among Healthcare Students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Medicina (Lithuania), 59, 5, (2023); Mousavi Baigi, Seyyedeh Fatemeh, Attitudes, knowledge, and skills towards artificial intelligence among healthcare students: A systematic review, Health Science Reports, 6, 3, (2023); Teng, Minnie Y., Health Care Students' Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence: Countrywide Survey in Canada, JMIR Medical Education, 8, 1, (2022); Saudi Arabia Ranks 1st in Government Strategy in Tortoises Global AI Index; Saudi Arabia Ranks 2nd in Global Study of AI Awareness; Ann Transl Med, (2020)","","University of Benin","","","","","","15969827; 15965996","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214381924"

As future healthcare practitioners, nursing students must be prepared to incorporate AI technologies into their job. This study aimed to explore the associated factors with nursing students’ intention to use AI. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional multi-centre design was used. A convenience sample of 1713 university nursing students from Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates completed a self-reported online instrument divided into five sections covering: (1) demographic sheet, (2) knowledge, (3) attitude, (4) perception and (5) intention questionnaire. Results: Most nursing students in Arab countries have moderate levels of knowledge, attitude, perception and intention towards the use of AI. There was a significant positive association between knowledge, attitude, perception and intention towards the use of AI. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that understanding of AI technologies, self-perception as tech-savvy, age, clinical performance in previous semesters and knowledge of AI were significant and positively correlated with intention. Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of targeted educational interventions and customised strategies to support AI integration within nursing education settings across Arab countries, equipping future nurses with the necessary skills and knowledge to use AI effectively in their practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Attitude; Intention; Knowledge; Nursing students; Perception","adult; article; artificial intelligence; attitude; Bahrain; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; Egypt; female; health care personnel; human; Iraq; knowledge; Kuwait; Lebanon; male; multicenter study; nurse; nursing education; nursing practice; nursing student; Oman; Palestine; perception; questionnaire; Saudi Arabia; self concept; United Arab Emirates; attitude to health; behavior; clinical trial; health personnel attitude; Middle East; psychology; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Intention; Male; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the Sultan Qaboos University under grant number [CON/NF/2023/27].","Deep Medicine how Artificial Intelligence can Make Healthcare Human Again, (2019); Biomed Inform Insights, (2016); Labrague, Leodoro J., Student nurses' attitudes, perceived utilization, and intention to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) technology in nursing practice: A cross-sectional study, Nurse Education in Practice, 73, (2023); Cho, Kyongah, Dual mediating effects of anxiety to use and acceptance attitude of artificial intelligence technology on the relationship between nursing students’ perception of and intention to use them: a descriptive study, BMC Nursing, 23, 1, (2024); Acut, Dharel P., Determinants of Teachers’ Intentions to Integrate Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) Into Physical Education and Health Curricula, pp. 439-471, (2024); Kashive, Neerja, Understanding user perception toward artificial intelligence (AI) enabled e-learning, International Journal of Information and Learning Technology, 38, 1, pp. 1-19, (2021); Labrague, Leodoro J., Factors influencing student nurses' readiness to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) in their studies and their perceived barriers to accessing AI technology: A cross-sectional study, Nurse Education Today, 130, (2023); Wang, Xiaoyan, Knowledge and attitudes toward artificial intelligence in nursing among various categories of professionals in China: a cross-sectional study, Frontiers in Public Health, 12, (2024); Al-Qerem, Walid A., Exploring knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards artificial intelligence among health professions’ students in Jordan, BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 23, 1, (2023); Al Shamsi, Jawaher Hamad, Understanding key drivers affecting students’ use of artificial intelligence-based voice assistants, Education and Information Technologies, 27, 6, pp. 8071-8091, (2022)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39696341","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212402624"

Method: Participants (N = 85 undergraduate university students; M age = 20.65 years [SD = 2.38]; 84 % female) were randomised to PSH (N = 42) or GSH-AI (N = 43). The intervention was a brief 11-module online cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism intervention completed over 4-weeks. GSH-AI participants were given suggested questions to ask AI for guidance in completing the intervention. Data were collected at baseline, 4- and 8-weeks post-randomisation. Results: Engagement was good, only one person in each group did not use any modules; module completion was equivalent across conditions (6.67, SD = 3.22 and 6.18, SD = 3.42 respectively). Between baseline and post-intervention people in the GSH-AI condition showed an almost 3.5 times increase in preferring support to be received from AI versus other modes of support. Only 52 % and 22 % of participants completed 4- and 8-week post-randomisation surveys, with no differences in psychological outcomes between the PSH and GSH-AI groups. Main effects of time indicated moderate to large within-group effect size improvements for disordered eating, stress, anxiety, and perfectionism. Conclusions: Qualitative feedback indicated that AI was initially acceptable as a guide and became even more acceptable after it had been experienced. Fully powered trials are required to determine the impact of AI guidance on outcomes, and whether type of AI platform (customised versus generic) and type of mental health disorder interact with its effects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anxiety; Artificial intelligence; Disordered eating; Guided self-help; Perfectionism; Treatment","adult; anxiety; Article; artificial intelligence; burnout; clinical outcome; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; e-mail; eating disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; emotion; feasibility study; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; human; human experiment; intelligence; male; mental health; outcome assessment; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; patient satisfaction; perfectionism; physiological stress; pilot study; psychotherapy; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; reliability; thematic analysis; training; virtual coach; young adult","","","TDW is a recipient of Investigator Grant 2025665 National Health and Medical Research Council.

Exposure during pregnancy may have a lifelong impact on the fetus. Services are needed to allow individuals to learn about their personal EDC exposures and how to reduce them. Million Marker (MM) aims to crowdsource and scale the biomonitoring of environmental chemicals and provide actionable results to empower individuals to proactively assess, track, and reduce their EDC exposures. In previous research, we developed and tested the first mobile EDC intervention service (mail-in urine testing and exposure report-back) for its efficacy in increasing EH literacy (EHL), willingness to reduce exposures (i.e., readiness to change, RtC), and system usability. After intervention, we found increased EHL, increased RtC in women (but not men), and decreased EDC exposure. However, some participants did not increase their RtC and had difficulty carrying out the intervention on their own. The reasons for these less optimal results were the difficulty in the EHL subject matter—participants still felt ill-prepared to apply their knowledge to making healthier lifestyle changes. Therefore, in this study, we will address these perceived limitations. Methods: We will test a self-directed online interactive curriculum with live counseling sessions and individualized support modeled after the highly effective Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Recruiting from the Healthy Nevada Project (HNP), one of the largest population health cohorts in the world, we test the effectiveness of our EDC-specific online intervention curriculum via EHL and RtC surveys and determine changes in EDC exposure before and after intervention in a randomized controlled trial. We will also test for common clinical biomarkers via a commercially available at-home test (Siphox). We will recruit and randomize 300 women and 300 men of reproductive age (total n=600) from HNP. Our target population is men and women of reproductive age (18–44 years old). Discussion: At the conclusion of this project, we will be well-positioned to scale our services to clinics and the general public, with the eventual aims of FDA approval, insurance coverage, and incorporation into routine clinical care. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","apolipoprotein AI; apolipoprotein B; C reactive protein; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; follitropin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydrocortisone; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; luteinizing hormone; Muellerian inhibiting factor; phthalic acid; prolactin; prostate specific antigen; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; thyroid hormone; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; academic achievement; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; attitude to health; behavior assessment; behavior change; body weight maintenance; cardiovascular disease; clinical audit; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; confidentiality; controlled study; counseling; data quality assessment; decision making; diabetes mellitus; Diabetes Prevention Program; digital health; economic well-being; education; environmental exposure; environmental health literacy; female; financial information system; food contamination; health care personnel; health care planning; health care policy; health care survey; health disparity; health program; health service; Healthy Nevada Project; human; human experiment; infertility; information literacy; information processing; International Physical Activity Questionnaire; intervention study; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; normal human; outcome assessment; Perceived Stress Scale; physical activity; pregnancy; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; reducing exposures to endocrine disruptors; reliability; reproductive age; research protocol; sample size; smoking; social cognition theory; social support; systolic blood pressure; text messaging; thyrotropin blood level; training; urinalysis; water contamination; adolescent; adverse event; biological monitoring; health literacy; prevention and control; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); urine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biological Monitoring; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Exposure; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Humans; Male; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Young Adult","","C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; estradiol, 50-28-2; follitropin, 9002-68-0; hydrocortisone, 50-23-7; luteinizing hormone, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; Muellerian inhibiting factor, 80497-65-0; phthalic acid, 88-99-3; prolactin, 12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4; testosterone, 58-22-0; Endocrine Disruptors","The REED study is supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Small Business Innovation Grant (R44ES034312).

The integration of AI knowledge into medical education is essential to equip future healthcare professionals with the skills needed to effectively leverage these advancements in their practices. Despite its significance, many medical schools have yet to incorporate AI into their curricula. This study aims to assess the attitudes of medical students in Thailand toward AI and its application in radiology, with the objective of better planning for its inclusion. Methods: Between February and June 2022, we conducted a survey in two Thai medical schools: Chiang Mai University in Northern Thailand and Prince of Songkla University in Southern Thailand. We employed 5-point Likert scale questions (ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree) to evaluate students’ opinions on three main aspects: (1) their understanding of AI, (2) the inclusion of AI in their medical education, and (3) the potential impact of AI on medicine and radiology. Results: Our findings revealed that merely 31% of medical students perceived to have a basic understanding of AI. Nevertheless, nearly all students (93.6%) recognized the value of AI training for their careers and strongly advocated for its inclusion in the medical school curriculum. Furthermore, those students who had a better understanding of AI were more likely to believe that AI would revolutionize the field of radiology (p = 0.02), making it more captivating and impactful (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Our study highlights a noticeable gap in the understanding of AI among medical students in Thailand and its practical applications in healthcare. However, the overwhelming consensus among these students is their readiness to embrace the incorporation of AI training into their medical education. This enthusiasm holds the promise of enhancing AI adoption, ultimately leading to an improvement in the standard of healthcare services in Thailand, aligning with the country’s healthcare vision. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Attitudes and perceptions; Medical students; Radiology and medicine; Thailand","article; artificial intelligence; attitude; cohort analysis; consensus; curriculum; female; health care personnel; health service; human; Likert scale; male; medical education; medical school; medical student; perception; radiology; Thailand; adult; education; health personnel attitude; psychology; questionnaire; Southeast Asian; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Male; Radiology; Southeast Asian People; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","The research was partially supported by Chiang Mai University (SA and CA).","Busnatu, Stefan S., Clinical Applications of Artificial Intelligence—An Updated Overview, Journal of Clinical Medicine, 11, 8, (2022); Lorkowski, Jacek, Overload of Medical Documentation: A Disincentive for Healthcare Professionals, Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, 1324, pp. 1-10, (2021); Clough, Reece Alexander James, Transforming healthcare documentation: harnessing the potential of AI to generate discharge summaries, BJGP Open, 8, 1, (2024); Angkurawaranon, Salita, A comparison of performance between a deep learning model with residents for localization and classification of intracranial hemorrhage, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Mello-Thoms, Claudia R., AI IN IMAGING AND THERAPY: INNOVATIONS, ETHICS, AND IMPACT: REVIEW ARTICLE Clinical applications of artificial intelligence in radiology, British Journal of Radiology, 96, 1150, (2023); Ahmad Khan, Faiz Ahmad, Chest x-ray analysis with deep learning-based software as a triage test for pulmonary tuberculosis: a prospective study of diagnostic accuracy for culture-confirmed disease, The Lancet Digital Health, 2, 11, pp. e573-e581, (2020); Murphy, Keelin, Computer aided detection of tuberculosis on chest radiographs: An evaluation of the CAD4TB v6 system, Scientific Reports, 10, 1, (2020); Automated Chest Radiography as A Triage for Xpert Testing in Resource Constrained Settings A Prospective Study of Diagnostic Accuracy and Costs; Automatic Hemorrhage Segmentation on Head CT Scan for Traumatic Brain Injury Using 3D Deep Learning Model; An Optimal Deep Learning Framework for Multi Type Hemorrhagic Lesions Detection and Quantification in Head CT Images for Traumatic Brain Injury 15737497 Electronic","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39438874","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207187140"

HPE students must also learn about AI to understand its impact on healthcare delivery. We examined HPE students’ AI-related knowledge and attitudes, and perceived challenges in integrating AI in HPE. Methods: This cross-sectional included medical, nursing, physiotherapy, and clinical nutrition students from four public universities in Jordan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Egypt. Data were collected between February and October 2023 via an online survey that covered five main domains: benefits of AI in healthcare, negative impact on patient trust, negative impact on the future of healthcare professionals, inclusion of AI in HPE curricula, and challenges hindering integration of AI in HPE. Results: Of 642 participants, 66.4% reported low AI knowledge levels. The UAE had the largest proportion of students with low knowledge (72.7%). The majority (54.4%) of participants had learned about AI outside their curriculum, mainly through social media (66%). Overall, 51.2% expressed positive attitudes toward AI, with Egypt showing the largest proportion of positive attitudes (59.1%). Although most participants viewed AI in healthcare positively (91%), significant variations were observed in other domains. The majority (77.6%) supported integrating AI in HPE, especially in Egypt (82.3%). A perceived negative impact of AI on patient trust was expressed by 43.5% of participants, particularly in Egypt (54.7%). Only 18.1% of participants were concerned about the impact of AI on future healthcare professionals, with the largest proportion from Egypt (33.0%). Some participants (34.4%) perceived AI integration as challenging, notably in the UAE (47.6%). Common barriers included lack of expert training (53%), awareness (50%), and interest in AI (41%). Conclusion: This study clarified key considerations when integrating AI in HPE. Enhancing students’ awareness and fostering innovation in an AI-driven medical landscape are crucial for effectively incorporating AI in HPE curricula. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Deep learning; Health sciences education; Machine learning; Medical education; Undergraduate education","adult; aged; article; artificial intelligence; awareness; controlled study; cross-sectional study; curriculum; deep learning; education; Egypt; female; health care delivery; health care personnel; health education; human; knowledge; learning; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical profession; physiotherapy; Saudi Arabia; social media; undergraduate education; United Arab Emirates; young adult; attitude to health; health personnel attitude; health student; Jordan; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Occupations; Humans; Male; Students, Health Occupations; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Janiesch, Christian, Machine learning and deep learning, Electronic Markets, 31, 3, pp. 685-695, (2021); Nagi, Fatima, Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Medical Education: A Scoping Review, Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 305, pp. 648-651, (2023); Hamet, Pavel, Artificial intelligence in medicine, Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental, 69, pp. S36-S40, (2017); Obermeyer, Ziad, Predicting the future-big data, machine learning, and clinical medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, 375, 13, pp. 1216-1219, (2016); Obermeyer, Ziad, Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations, Science, 366, 6464, pp. 447-453, (2019); Allam, Ahmed Hafez, Knowledge, attitude, and perception of Arab medical students towards artificial intelligence in medicine and radiology: A multi-national cross-sectional study, European Radiology, 34, 7, pp. 1-14, (2024); Briganti, Giovanni, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Today and Tomorrow, Frontiers in Medicine, 7, (2020); Saibene, Aurora, Expert systems: Definitions, advantages and issues in medical field applications, Expert Systems with Applications, 177, (2021); Çalışkan, Süleyman Ayhan, Artificial intelligence in medical education curriculum: An e-Delphi study for competencies, PLOS ONE, 17, 7 July, (2022); Jmir Med Educ, (2019)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39425151","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206851227"

Methods: The study was conducted between October 16, 2023, and January 16, 2024, with participants consisting of volunteers from dental faculties in Turkey. A total of 335 undergraduate students and 62 specialty students participated in the survey, which utilized non-probability convenience and snowball sampling methods. Cronbach’s alpha was utilized to measure the internal consistency of the scale. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 26.0, with quantitative data presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical data as frequency (percentage). The statistical level was set at 0.05, and the analysis involved Pearson’s Chi-square test and Fisher-Freeman-Halton tests. Results: The results indicate that undergraduate and specialty students perceive the integration of large datasets as the primary advantage of AI. The speed, objectivity, and potential to reduce misdiagnosis rates associated with AI are also highlighted. Undergraduate students express more significant concern about the impact of AI on patient understanding and empathy compared to specialty students. Additionally, both groups strongly advocate for the inclusion of AI-related courses in dental education and acknowledge the indispensability of AI in dental practice. The significant roles of AI in dentistry, such as providing evidence-based dental approaches and compensating for human intellectual limitations, are widely recognized. Furthermore, consensus exists that AI will primarily assist in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Conclusions: The findings emphasize the importance of cautiously managing AI’s role in healthcare services and underscore the need to prioritize patient privacy and data security. AI should be regarded as a complement to the work of dental professionals rather than a substitute. The study recommends further research involving a larger and more diverse sample to obtain a comprehensive understanding of attitudes toward AI in dentistry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Dental Education; Dental Education Assessment; Dental Students; Health Education & Awareness","adult; artificial intelligence; attitude to health; dental education; dental student; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; psychology; questionnaire; turkey (bird); young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Education, Dental; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Students, Dental; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey; Young Adult","","","","Shan, Tiantian, Application of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry, Journal of Dental Research, 100, 3, pp. 232-244, (2021); Carrillo-Pérez, Francisco, Applications of artificial intelligence in dentistry: A comprehensive review, Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry, 34, 1, pp. 259-280, (2022); J Dent Fac Ataturk Univ, (2021); Hung, Kuo Feng, Current applications, opportunities, and limitations of AI for 3D imaging in dental research and practice, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 12, pp. 1-18, (2020); Karan-Romero, Milan, Evaluation of Attitudes and Perceptions in Students about the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry, Dentistry Journal, 11, 5, (2023); Kim, Clara S., Artificial intelligence (A.I.) in dental curricula: Ethics and responsible integration, Journal of Dental Education, 87, 11, pp. 1570-1573, (2023); Glick, Aaron, Impact of explainable artificial intelligence assistance on clinical decision-making of novice dental clinicians, JAMIA Open, 5, 2, (2022); Clin Exp Health Sci, (2021); Yüzbaşıoğlu, Emir, Attitudes and perceptions of dental students towards artificial intelligence, Journal of Dental Education, 85, 1, pp. 60-68, (2021); Roganović, Jelena R., Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Survey on Dentists’ and Final-Year Undergraduates’ Perspectives, Healthcare (Switzerland), 11, 10, (2023)","","BioMed Central Ltd","","","","","","14726920","","","39407168","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206556560"

While CXR is a common and cost-effective diagnostic tool, interpreting the high volume of CXRs is challenging due to workforce limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise in enhancing efficiency and accuracy. However, real-world applicability and generalizability across diverse patient cohorts remain areas of concerns. In our study, the LUNIT INSIGHT CXR Triage software was evaluated in a diverse patient cohort. Forty-three radiologists, blinded to AI results, assessed CXRs categorized into normal, non-urgent, and urgent using a 3-tier classification system. Performance metrics and turnaround times were analyzed. The AI system demonstrated sensitivity of 89% for normal CXRs, specificity of 93%, PPV of 83%, and NPV of 95%, with an F1 score of 0.86 and an AUC of 0.91. For non-urgent CXRs, sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 91%, with PPV and NPV at 94% and 89%, respectively, and an F1 score of 0.94 and an AUC of 0.92. In the urgent category, sensitivity was 82%, specificity 99%, PPV 90%, and NPV 98%. Subgroup analysis revealed consistently high accuracy across various age groups (Young, Adult, Senior), genders, and ethnicities (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others), with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC consistently above 84%. The AI system also significantly reduced turnaround times across all subgroups, indicating its robust performance and generalizability in diverse healthcare settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Chest x-ray; Diagnostic imaging; Impact evaluation; Radiology; Risk stratification","adolescent; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence triaging system; child; clinical practice; clinical study; cohort analysis; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; emergency medicine; evaluation study; female; health care delivery; health care quality; human; infant; male; middle aged; newborn; observational study; patient triage; pneumothorax; point of care testing; prospective clinical study; radiologist; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; validation study; very elderly; X ray; young adult; lung disease; procedures; prospective study; reproducibility; software; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; Triage; Young Adult","","","","Jones, Catherine M., Chest radiographs and machine learning – Past, present and future, Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology, 65, 5, pp. 538-544, (2021); Kim, Junghyun, Role of chest radiographs in early lung cancer detection, Translational Lung Cancer Research, 9, 3, pp. 522-531, (2020); Fehr, Jana, Computer-aided interpretation of chest radiography reveals the spectrum of tuberculosis in rural South Africa, npj Digital Medicine, 4, 1, (2021); Irmici, Giovanni, Chest X-ray in Emergency Radiology: What Artificial Intelligence Applications Are Available?, Diagnostics, 13, 2, (2023); Ko, Chihhsiang, Demands for medical imaging and workforce Size: A nationwide population-based Study, 2000–2020, European Journal of Radiology, 172, (2024); Goh, Charles Xian Yang, The Growing Problem of Radiologist Shortages: Perspectives From Singapore, Korean Journal of Radiology, 24, 12, pp. 1176-1178, (2023); Meng, Fanyang, The Growing Problem of Radiologist Shortage: China’s Perspective, Korean Journal of Radiology, 24, 11, pp. 1046-1048, (2023); Cureus, (2023); undefined, (2022); Bennani, Souhail, Using AI to Improve Radiologist Performance in Detection of Abnormalities on Chest Radiographs, Radiology, 309, 3, (2023)","","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","","","","","","0720048X; 18727727","","EJRAD","39405809","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206185205"

It was examined medical students’ personal values profiles and the perceived influence of social media on self-aspects. All participants (N = 151) were Romanian and English module students, young (average age = 19.2, SD = 1.5), 68,9% females and 31,1% males. Pearson coefficient correlation analyses were performed to verify the associations between the main four clusters of personal values (Self Transcendence, Self Enhancement, Openness to change and Conservationism) with social media behaviors and psychological wellbeing. The most frequent cluster of values was Self-Transcendence (M = 5.21) while the least was Self-Enhancement (M = 4.05). There was no significant correlation between social media addiction, psychological wellbeing and a specific cluster of values while the perception of self-aspects influenced by social media included involvement in community problems, creativity for Openness to change group (R =.24;.22, p <.05), tolerance towards sexual minorities and self-evaluation in Self Transcendence group (R =.24;.21;.42, p <.05) while Conservationism and Self Enhancement groups didn`t report any change.

In addition, 66.7% of them showed positive attitudes towards ChatGPT. While 61.3% of the healthcare students perceived that ChatGPT may increase productivity and 84.7% of them revealed that it has a positive impact on education. The mean perceptions score of ChatGPT was significantly higher among females (22.64 ± 6.36) comparing male students (21.71 ± 4.66) (t = 1.551; p = 0.001). Similarly, the mean perception score of ChatGPT was higher among pharmacy (22.99 ± 5.48) compared to other healthcare students (F = 4.941; p = 0.008). The current findings concluded that most of the healthcare students are familiar with ChatGPT and show positive perceptions, and perceived that ChatGPT may increase productivity and have a positive impact on education. Therefore, we recommend future studies concentrate on enhancing the ethical and successful application of AI tools and ChatGPT in the academic setting is pivotal. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence nursing students; Assignment; ChatGPT; Healthcare students; Technology","adult; cross-sectional study; female; health personnel attitude; health student; human; male; perception; pharmacy student; psychology; questionnaire; Saudi Arabia; student; young adult; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Students; Students, Health Occupations; Students, Pharmacy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","The authors of this study extend their appreciation to Researchers Supporting Project (Project number RSPD2024R1099), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Alkhaaldi, Saif M.I., Medical Student Experiences and Perceptions of ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence: Cross-Sectional Study, JMIR Medical Education, 9, 1, (2023); Chatgpt for Higher Education and Professional Development A Guide to Conversational AI, (2023); Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir, Knowledge, Perceptions and Attitude of Researchers Towards Using ChatGPT in Research, Journal of Medical Systems, 48, 1, (2024); Syed, Wajid, Assessment of Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial Intelligence among Healthcare Students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Medicina (Lithuania), 59, 5, (2023); Dwivedi, Yogesh K., “So what if ChatGPT wrote it?” Multidisciplinary perspectives on opportunities, challenges and implications of generative conversational AI for research, practice and policy, International Journal of Information Management, 71, (2023); Hu, Jeming, Health Care Trainees’ and Professionals’ Perceptions of ChatGPT in Improving Medical Knowledge Training: Rapid Survey Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 25, 1, (2023); Chatgpt; Lo, Chung Kwan, What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education?

Autistic children, who have difficulties in social communication and often increased anxiety, tend to show a strong preference for music, because it can be structured and systematic, and therefore more predictable than social interaction. This makes music therapy a promising medium for therapeutic support and intervention. Previous clinical trials of music therapy compared to traditional therapy for autistic children have shown encouraging but nevertheless mixed results. Key aims: The primary aim is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of improvisational music therapy for autistic children and test its effectiveness in at improving social communication and wellbeing, and to reduce anxiety. Research plan: The RCT will be conducted with 200 autistic children in the UK aged 7 to 11 years old. Participants will be randomly assigned to either improvisational music therapy or support as usual. The trial will be an assessor-blind, pragmatic two-arm cluster RCT comparing the impact of 12-weeks of improvisational music therapy in addition to support as usual, vs. support as usual for autistic children. Methods: Researchers who are blind to which arm the children are in will conduct assessments and obtain data via caregiver reports. The primary outcome will be the absolute change in the total score of the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) assessed at baseline, T1 (13 weeks) and T2 (39 weeks) follow-ups. The BOSCC consists of specific items that were developed to identify changes in social-communication behaviours. Secondary outcome measures include: (1) Parent reported anxiety scale for youth with ASD (Note that we do not use the term ‘ASD’ or Autism Spectrum Disorder, because many autistic people feel it is stigmatising. Instead, we use the term ‘autism’) (PRAS-ASD) (2) Young Child Outcome Rating Scale, for wellbeing (YCORS), (3) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ); and (4) Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS). (5) The Children’s Communication Checklist-2 (CCC-2) will be completed to evaluate pragmatic speech with fluent speakers only; (6) The Music Engagement Scale (MES); and (7) Assessment of the Quality of Relationship (AQR) will be used to evaluate the child-therapist relationships using video-analysis of music therapy sessions. Additional data will be collected by administering the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II), Music at Home Questionnaire (M@H), and children’s versions of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Audio and video data from the therapy sessions will be collected and analysed (using both human and computer-based feature-coding, e.g., machine learning and AI-driven methods) to identify how music and non-musical interactions foster change throughout the therapy. Discussion: This study aims to observe if the interactions, engagement, and therapeutic modalities fostered during music therapy sessions can translate to non-musical contexts and improve autistic children’s social communication skills, identifying possible mediating factors contributing to the effectiveness of music therapy, potentially informing policy making and governance.

The digital transformation will undoubtedly affect today’s medical students. This study focuses on trust from the perspective of three groups of medical students - students from Croatia, students from Slovakia, and international students studying in Slovakia. Methods: A paper-pen survey was conducted using a non-probabilistic convenience sample. In the second half of 2022, 1715 students were surveyed at five faculties in Croatia and three in Slovakia. Results: Specifically, 38.2% of students indicated familiarity with the concept of AI, while 44.8% believed they would use AI in the future. Patient readiness for the implementation of technologies was mostly assessed as being low. More than half of the students, 59.1%, believe that the implementation of digital technology (AI) will negatively impact the patient-physician relationship and 51,3% of students believe that patients will trust physicians less. The least agreement with the statement was observed among international students, while a higher agreement was expressed by Slovak and Croatian students 40.9% of Croatian students believe that users do not trust the healthcare system, 56.9% of Slovak students agree with this view, while only 17.3% of international students share this opinion. The ability to explain to patients how AI works if they were asked was statistically significantly different for the different student groups, international students expressed the lowest agreement, while the Slovak and Croatian students showed a higher agreement. Conclusion: This study provides insight into medical students’ attitudes from Croatia, Slovakia, and international students regarding the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the future healthcare system, with a particular emphasis on the concept of trust. A notable difference was observed between the three groups of students, with international students differing from their Croatian and Slovak colleagues. This study also highlights the importance of integrating AI topics into the medical curriculum, taking into account national social & cultural specificities that could negatively impact AI implementation if not carefully addressed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Medical AI; Medical ethics; Medical students; Patient-physician relationship; Quantitative study; Trust","article; artificial intelligence; comparative study; convenience sample; Croatia; Croatian (citizen); curriculum; digital technology; digital transformation; doctor patient relationship; female; health care system; human; major clinical study; male; medical ethics; medical practice; medical student; physician; quantitative study; Slovakia; student attitude; trust; young adult; adult; health personnel attitude; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Humans; Male; Physician-Patient Relations; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the Hrvatska zaklada za znanost (Croatian Science Foundation (CSF)) [grant number UIP-2019-04-3212] \u201C(New) Ethical and Social Challenges of Digital Technologies in the Healthcare Domain\u201D.

This study aimed to identify factors causing mental health challenges among radiography students, understand their academic impact, and explore lecturers' potential roles in supporting students' well-being at a Zimbabwean tertiary institution. Methods: A qualitative explorative study employing in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 radiography students and eight educators was conducted. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim using Otter.ai software. The data was then analyzed inductively using thematic analysis in Nvivo 12, following Braun and Clarke's six-step approach. Results: Three themes were created that describe the factors causing mental health challenges among radiography students, their academic impact, and lecturers' potential roles in supporting students' well-being. The themes are i. Mental health challenges in diverse social, personal, and environmental landscapes ii. Coping and building resilience, and iii. Educator roles in holistic support for mental health and personal growth. A six-step “Cascade” model of the educator roles was proposed. Conclusions: The study highlights the complex mental health issues faced by radiography students, emphasizing the need for increased attention, resources, and support in academic environments. It highlights the importance of encouraging healthy coping strategies and cultivating a well-being culture, with educators playing a crucial role in fostering friendly environments and providing comprehensive support.

Understanding the genetics of sudden death in the young (SDY) enables family counseling and cascade screening. The objective of this study was to characterize genetic variation in an SDY cohort using whole genome sequencing. Methods: The SDY Case Registry is a National Institutes of Health/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance effort to discern the prevalence, causes, and risk factors for SDY. The SDY Case Registry prospectively collected clinical data and DNA biospecimens from SDY cases < 20 years of age. SDY cases were collected from medical examiner and coroner offices spanning 13 US jurisdictions from 2015 to 2019. The cohort included 211 children (median age 0.33 year; range 0–20 years), determined to have died suddenly and unexpectedly and from whom DNA biospecimens for DNA extractions and next-of-kin consent were ascertained. A control cohort consisted of 211 randomly sampled, sex- and ancestry-matched individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Genetic variation was evaluated in epilepsy, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia genes in the SDY and control cohorts. American College of Medical Genetics/Genomics guidelines were used to classify variants as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Additionally, pathogenic and likely pathogenic genetic variation was identified using a Bayesian-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Results: The SDY cohort was 43% European, 29% African, 3% Asian, 16% Hispanic, and 9% with mixed ancestries and 39% female. Six percent of the cohort was found to harbor a pathogenic or likely pathogenic genetic variant in an epilepsy, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmia gene. The genomes of SDY cases, but not controls, were enriched for rare, potentially damaging variants in epilepsy, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia-related genes. A greater number of rare epilepsy genetic variants correlated with younger age at death. Conclusions: While damaging cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genes are recognized contributors to SDY, we also observed an enrichment in epilepsy-related genes in the SDY cohort and a correlation between rare epilepsy variation and younger age at death. These findings emphasize the importance of considering epilepsy genes when evaluating SDY. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arrhythmia; Cardiomyopathy; Epilepsy; Gene burden; Genome sequencing; Sudden death in the young","DNA; adolescent; adult; African; age; Article; artificial intelligence; Asian; Bayes theorem; cardiomyopathy; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease registry; DNA extraction; epilepsy; epilepsy gene; European; female; gender; gene; gene function; genetic variation; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; Hispanic; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; practice guideline; prospective study; risk factor; sudden death; United States; whole genome sequencing; complication; genetic screening; genetics; sudden cardiac death; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Cardiomyopathies; Child; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Epilepsy; Female; Genetic Testing; Humans; Infant; Male","","DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA","Funding text 1: This work used Stampede2 at The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) through allocation XRAC - BIO220012 (PI MJP) from the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which was supported by National Science Foundation grant number #1548562 [].

This rapid review evaluated GenAI’s application and the role of co-design in supporting mental health of children and young people. Recent Findings: Nine studies were included. Studies used a range of GenAI technologies, such as conversational agents and therapeutic simulations, to enhance engagement and personalisation in mental health care for young people. Co-design approaches, involving workshops, focus groups, and iterative feedback were variously used in the studies. Summary: This review highlights the transformative potential of GenAI in delivering engaging and tailored mental health support for children and young people. However, rigorous evaluation of long-term impact and scalability is needed. Integration of GenAI tools into human-led care, safeguards, and ethical frameworks also remain critical areas of future research to ensure privacy, clinical standards, and trust in digital mental health solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children and young people; Generative artificial intelligence; Mental health","","","","Funding text 1: Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.; Funding text 2: The study was funded by a 2024 University of Technology Sydney (UTS) Disability Access and Inclusion Grant, awarded to the lead author as the Chief Investigator (CI).","Mental Health of Adolescents, (2021); Gnanavel, Sundar, Challenges and opportunities for early career child mental health professionals during the COVID19 pandemic, Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 54, (2020); Gnanavel, Sundar, Child and adolescent psychiatry research during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Lancet Psychiatry, 7, 9, (2020); Panchal, Urvashi, The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on child and adolescent mental health: systematic review, European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 32, 7, pp. 1151-1177, (2023); Theberath, Monique, Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents: A systematic review of survey studies, SAGE Open Medicine, 10, (2022); Prevention of Mental Disorders Effective Interventions and Policy Options, (2004); Ramshaw, Gemma, Introduction of Technology to Support Young People’s Care and Mental Health—A Rapid Evidence Review, Child and Youth Care Forum, 52, 3, pp. 509-531, (2023); Oostermeijer, Sanne, Implementing and Delivering Youth Mental Health Services: Approaches Taken by the Australian Primary Health Network ‘Lead Sites’, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 17, (2022); Cummings, Janet R., Challenges facing mental health systems arising from the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from 14 European and North American countries, Health Policy, 136, (2023); King, Darlene R., An Introduction to Generative Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health Care: Considerations and Guidance, Current Psychiatry Reports, 25, 12, pp. 839-846, (2023)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21962987","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003295477"

In response to this knowledge gap, our study employs the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework and implements a serial mediation model to probe into the impacts of compulsive ChatGPT usage on users' mental health outcomes. This model serves as a powerful analytical lens, allowing us to unravel the relationships between the stimulus (compulsive ChatGPT usage), organism (anxiety and burnout), and response (sleep disturbance). Using a cross-sectional survey design, we collected data from 2602 ChatGPT users in Vietnam via purposive sampling and utilized structural equation modeling to assess the hypothesis model. The findings confirm that compulsive ChatGPT usage directly correlates with heightened anxiety, burnout, and sleep disturbance. Moreover, compulsive usage indirectly contributes to sleep disturbance through anxiety and burnout, demonstrating a significant serial mediation effect. This expanded understanding, derived from a sizable and diverse user base, positions our research at the forefront of unraveling the intricate dynamics between AI adoption and mental well-being. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anxiety; Burnout; Compulsive ChatGPT usage; Sleep disturbance; Stimulus-organism-response model","adolescent; adult; anxiety; artificial intelligence; burnout; cross-sectional study; female; human; internet addiction; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; sleep disorder; Viet Nam; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Artificial Intelligence; Burnout, Psychological; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internet Addiction Disorder; Male; Middle Aged; Sleep Wake Disorders; Vietnam; Young Adult","","","","Akungu, Okwach Alphonce, Longitudinal association of adolescents’ perceptions of parental mediations and compulsive Internet use, Computers in Human Behavior, 150, (2024); Ali, Faizan, Can the compulsive use of e-learning lead to lower academic performance?

In England one in four children experienced poor mental health in 2022. Social prescribing is gaining traction as a systems-based approach, which builds upon person-centered methods, to refer children and young people with non-clinical mental health issues to appropriate community assets. Recognition of social prescribing benefits for children’s mental health is increasing, yet evidence is limited. Inconsistent terminology and variation of terms used to describe social prescribing practices across the literature hinders understanding and assessment of social prescribing’s impact on children’s mental health. This scoping review thus aims to systematically identify and analyse the various terms, concepts and language used to describe social prescribing with children and young people across the wider health and social care literature base. The scoping review will be undertaken using a six-stage framework which includes: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data, collating, summarising and reporting the results, and consultation. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, PsychInfo, Social Policy Practice, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane library and Joanna Briggs), alongside evidence from grey literature, hand search, citation tracking, and use of expert correspondence will be included in the review to ensure published and unpublished literature is captured. Data extraction will be carried out by two reviewers using a predefined form to capture study characteristics, intervention descriptions, outcomes, and key terms used to report social prescribing for children and young people. No formal quality appraisal or risk of bias evaluation will be performed, as this scoping review aims to map and describe the literature. Data will be stored and managed using the Rayaan.ai platform and a critical narrative of the common themes found will be included. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; Article; child; consultation; data analysis; data base; data extraction; decision making; human; mental health; open access publishing; prescribing practice; reporting bias; scoping review; social prescribing; young adult; adolescent; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Adolescent; Child; COVID-19; Humans; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2","","","","Build Back Fairer the Covid 19 Marmot Reviewthe Health Foundation; Hewitt Review an Independent Review of Integrated Care Systems, (2023); Nhs Long Term Plan, (2019); Kings Fund, (2020); Muhl, Caitlin, Establishing internationally accepted conceptual and operational definitions of social prescribing through expert consensus: a Delphi study, BMJ Open, 13, 7, (2023); Int J Popul Data Sc, (2022); Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2020 Wave 1 Follow Up to the 2017 Survey, (2020); State of Childrens Mental Health Services 2020 21, (2021); Improving Quality of Mental Health Care for Children Adolescents and Young People; Are We Listening A Review of Children and Young People S Mental Health Services, (2019)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","39514480","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208570066"

Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled. Indoor levels of fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored using a portable detector for 7 days. Together, a 7-day monitoring was performed through a wireless patch that continuously recorded electrocardiogram, respiratory activity and actigraphy. Indexes of CAC during wake and sleep time were derived from the biosignals: heart rate and low-frequency to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF), index of sympathovagal balance with higher values corresponding to a predominance of the sympathetic branch. Cyclic variation of heart rate index (CVHRI events/hour) during sleep, a proxy for the evaluation of sleep apnea, was assessed for each night. After the monitoring, blood samples were collected to assess the inflammatory profile. Regression and correlation analyses were performed. A positive association between VOC exposure and the CVHRI (Δ% = +0.2% for 1 μg/m3 VOCs, p = 0.008) was found. The CVHRI was also positively associated with LF/HF during sleep, thus higher CVHRI values corresponded to a shift of the sympathovagal balance towards a sympathetic predominance (r = 0.52; p = 0.018). NO<inf>2</inf> exposure was positively associated with both the pro-inflammatory biomarker TREM-1 and the anti-inflammatory biomarker IL-10 (Δ% = +1.2% and Δ% = +2.4%, for 1 μg/m3 NO<inf>2</inf>; p = 0.005 and p = 0.022, respectively). The study highlights a possible causal relationship between IAP exposure and higher risk of sleep apnea events, associated with impaired CAC during sleep, and a pro-inflammatory state counterbalanced by an increased anti-inflammatory response in healthy subjects. This process may be disrupted in vulnerable populations, leading to a harmful chronic pro-inflammatory profile. Thus, IAP may emerge as a critical and often neglected risk factor for the public health that can be addressed through targeted preventive interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cardiovascular autonomic control; Heart rate variability; Indoor air pollution; Inflammation; Sleep","Bioremediation; Cardiology; Catalytic oxidation; Electrocardiograms; Heart; Indoor air pollution; Pathology; Sleep research; Tachometers; Autonomic control; Cardiovascular autonomic control; Healthy subjects; Heart rate variability; Indoor air; Inflammation; NO 2; Sleep; Sleep time; Volatile organics; Nitrogen oxides; biological marker; glycoprotein; interleukin 10; membrane receptor; nitrogen dioxide; soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; indoor air; particulate matter; public health; risk factor; sleep; actimetry; adrenergic system; adult; air monitoring; air pollutant; Article; autonomic dysfunction; autonomic nervous system function; blood sampling; breathing; cardiovascular autonomic control; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk factor; cohort analysis; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; cyclic variation of heart rate index; electrocardiogram; female; heart rate; high risk population; human; human experiment; human impact (environment); index of sympathovagal balance; indoor air pollution; inflammation; low frequency to high frequency ratio; male; nervous system parameters; normal human; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PM2.5 exposure; pollution exposure; sleep apnea syndromes; sleep quality; sleep time; wakefulness; adverse event; autonomic nervous system; drug effect; middle aged; pathophysiology; young adult; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Autonomic Nervous System; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Volatile Organic Compounds; Young Adult","","nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; Air Pollutants; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Volatile Organic Compounds","The authors acknowledge funding support from the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) through the Programma Operativo Nazionale (PON) \u201CRicerca e Innovazione\u201D 2014\u20132020.","undefined, (2024); Accinelli, Roberto, Adherence to reduced-polluting biomass fuel stoves improves respiratory and sleep symptoms in children, BMC Pediatrics, 14, 1, (2014); Bellocchi, Chiara, The Interplay between Autonomic Nervous System and Inflammation across Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 23, 5, (2022); Lancet Glob Health, (2021); Billings, Martha E., The association of ambient air pollution with sleep apnea: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, Annals of the American Thoracic Society, 16, 3, pp. 363-370, (2019); Blaustein, Jacob R., Environmental Impacts on Cardiovascular Health and Biology: An Overview, Circulation Research, 134, 9, pp. 1048-1060, (2024); Borghi, Francesca, Miniaturized monitors for assessment of exposure to air pollutants: A review, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14, 8, (2017); Brauer, Michael, Taking a Stand against Air Pollution—The Impact on Cardiovascular Disease, Circulation, 143, 14, pp. E800-E804, (2021); Calderón-Garcidueñas, Lilian, Immunotoxicity and environment: Immunodysregulation and systemic inflammation in children, Toxicologic Pathology, 37, 2, pp. 161-169, (2009); Campagnolo, Davide, VOCs and aldehydes source identification in European office buildings - The OFFICAIR study, Building and Environment, 115, pp. 18-24, (2017)","","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","10960953; 00139351","","ENVRA","39142457","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201315386"

There is a need for neurosurgeons capable of critically appraising AI literature to evaluate its implementation or communicate information to patients. However, there are a lack of courses delivered at a level appropriate for individuals to develop such skills. We assessed the impact of a 2-day (non-credit bearing) online digital literacy course on the ability of individuals to critically appraise AI literature in neurosurgery. Methods: We performed a prospective, quasi-experimental non-randomized, controlled study with an intervention arm comprising individuals enrolled in our 2-day digital health literacy course and a waiting-list control arm used for comparison. We assessed participants' pre- and post-course knowledge, confidence, and course acceptability using Qualtrics surveys designed for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 62 individuals (33 participants, 29 waitlist controls), including neurosurgical trainees and both undergraduate and post-graduate students, attended the course and completed the pre-course survey. The 2 groups did not vary significantly in terms of age or demographics. Following the course, participants significantly improved in their knowledge of AI (mean difference = 3.86, 95% CI = 2.97–4.75, P-value < 0.0001) and confidence in critically appraising literature using AI (P-value = 0.002). Similar differences in knowledge (mean difference = 3.15, 95% CI = 1.82–4.47, P-value < 0.0001) and confidence (P-value < 0.0001) were found when compared to the control group. Conclusions: Bespoke courses delivered at an appropriate level can improve clinicians' understanding of the application of AI in neurosurgery, without the need for in-depth technical knowledge or programming skills. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Digital literacy; Graduate medical education; Machine learning; Medical education","adult; article; artificial intelligence; career; controlled study; digital health; female; graduate student; health literacy; hospital admission; human; internet literacy; knowledge; machine learning; male; medical education; middle aged; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; curriculum; education; prospective study; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Curriculum; Female; Health Literacy; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Young Adult","","","Conflict of interest statement: H.J.M. is supported by The Wellcome.

However, there are few studies on the impact of these psychological problems on college students’ English learning. As a special group about to enter society, studying the mental health of college students in foreign language learning is of great significance. This paper discusses the principle of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and the interactive mechanism to support college students’ foreign language learning. Additionally, the adaptability supporting college students’ foreign language learning is analyzed according to the current situation of AI supporting foreign language learning. Then, the mental health of college students in the AI environment is investigated and analyzed. This paper takes foreign and non-foreign language majors of Changchun University of Technology as the object and uses questionnaires, interviews, and classroom observation to obtain basic data. The results show that college students’ adaptability to foreign language learning is higher than that of non-foreign. Students’ intelligent operation and knowledge storage level impact their adaptability to foreign language learning. Psychological health problems include learning anxiety, loneliness, depression, and inferiority in college students’ foreign language learning. These negative emotions, to a certain extent, affect the learning effect of college students’ foreign language learning. This paper is of great significance to the adaptability of college students’ foreign language learning to the intelligent environment and the analysis of their mental health problems. This paper hopes to provide data reference for the research on improving college students’ foreign language learning effects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptability analysis; Artificial Intelligence; Foreign language learning; Psychological health; Questionnaire investigation","Article; artificial intelligence; college student; emotion; foreign language; human; interview; language; language development; learning; loneliness; mental disease; mental health; psychological well-being; questionnaire; adult; female; male; multilingualism; physiology; psychological adjustment; psychology; student; university; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Language; Learning; Male; Mental Health; Multilingualism; Students; Universities; Young Adult","","","","Abrahams, Loes, Social-Emotional Skill Assessment in Children and Adolescents: Advances and Challenges in Personality, Clinical, and Educational Contexts, Psychological Assessment, 31, 4, pp. 460-473, (2019); Ayedoun, Emmanuel, Adding Communicative and Affective Strategies to an Embodied Conversational Agent to Enhance Second Language Learners’ Willingness to Communicate, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 29, 1, pp. 29-57, (2019); Brackett, Marc A., RULER: A Theory-Driven, Systemic Approach to Social, Emotional, and Academic Learning, Educational Psychologist, 54, 3, pp. 144-161, (2019); Cui, Jun, The impact of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial mindset of college students in China: The mediating role of inspiration and the role of educational attributes, International Journal of Management Education, 19, 1, (2021); Dehghanzadeh, Hojjat, Using gamification to support learning English as a second language: a systematic review, Computer Assisted Language Learning, 34, 7, pp. 934-957, (2021); Gao, Xuesong(Andy), Multilingualism and higher education in Greater China, Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 40, 7, pp. 555-561, (2019); Gelles, Laura Ann, Compassionate flexibility and self-discipline: Student adaptation to emergency remote teaching in an integrated engineering energy course during covid-19, Education Sciences, 10, 11, pp. 1-23, (2020); Gilar-Corbí, Raquel, Can emotional intelligence be improved?

Materials and Methods: We analyzed an original survey of U.S. adults using the NORC AmeriSpeak Panel (n ¼ 1787). We conducted paired t-tests to assess differences in comfort with AI applications. We conducted weighted univariable regression and 2 weighted logistic regression models to identify predictors of expected benefit with and without accounting for trust in the health system. Results: Comfort with the use of ChatGPT in society is relatively low and different from other, common uses of AI. Comfort was highly associated with expecting benefit. Other statistically significant factors in multivariable analysis (not including system trust) included feeling respected and low privacy concerns. Females, younger adults, and those with higher levels of education were less likely to expect benefits in models with and without system trust, which was positively associated with expecting benefits (P¼ 1.6 × 10−11). Tech-savviness was not associated with the outcome. Discussion: Understanding the impact of large language models (LLMs) from the patient perspective is critical to ensuring that expectations align with performance as a form of calibrated trust that acknowledges the dynamic nature of trust. Conclusion: Including measures of system trust in evaluating LLMs could capture a range of issues critical for ensuring patient acceptance of this technological innovation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; large language model; patient trust; public opinion","adult; age; Article; ChatGPT; comfort; education; expectation; female; gender; health care; human; male; middle aged; privacy; respect; trust; United States; adolescent; aged; artificial intelligence; public opinion; questionnaire; telemedicine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Privacy; Public Opinion; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Trust; Young Adult","","","The authors are grateful for the support of a grant from the National Institutes of Health, The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), Public Trust of Artificial Intelligence in the Precision CDS Health Ecosystem (Grant No. 1-RO1-EB030492).","Guardian, (2023); Rules for Artificial Intelligence J United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary; Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early Experiments with Gpt 4, (2023); Programsail Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Learning Health Systems; Microsoft and Epic Expand Strategic Collaboration with Integration of Azure Openai Service, (2023); Mesko, Bertalan, The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or generative AI) in healthcare, npj Digital Medicine, 6, 1, (2023); Taylor, Lauren A., Fifty Years of Trust Research in Health Care: A Synthetic Review, Milbank Quarterly, 101, 1, pp. 126-178, (2023); Ars Technica, (2023); Jakesch, Maurice, Co-Writing with Opinionated Language Models Affects Users' Views, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, (2023); Egems Wash Dc, (2019)","","Oxford University Press","","","","","","1527974X; 10675027","","JAMAF","38960730","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201748273"

Objectives: This study models the impact of simulated caloric reduction on nutrient adequacy among U.S. adults ≥19 y with overweight or obesity using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2015–2018). Methods: Four levels of caloric reduction (20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%) were modeled by prorating daily calorie intake such that usual intakes of 14 nutrients were reduced proportional to caloric reduction. The percentages below the estimated average requirement (EAR) or above the adequate intake (AI) were estimated at each level of caloric reduction, with and without dietary supplement use. Differences across percentages of simulated caloric reductions were determined using nonoverlapping confidence intervals of the means (97.5th percentile confidence intervals were used to approximate P < 0.05). Results: There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in percentages below the EAR (above the AI) between sequential levels of simulated caloric reduction for most of the nutrients analyzed (protein, vitamins A, B-6, folate, and C, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc). For example, after a simulated 30% caloric reduction, 25%–40% of the population had intakes below the EAR for protein, vitamin B-6, and zinc, and 75%–91% of the population had intakes below the EAR for vitamin A, calcium, and magnesium (vs. 4%–18% and 45%–56%, respectively, without caloric reduction). With the inclusion of dietary supplements, percentages below the EAR for all nutrients (except protein) were lower than those for food alone. Conclusions: Caloric reduction may exacerbate nutrient inadequacies among adults with overweight or obesity. Inclusion of nutrient-dense foods, fortified foods, specially formulated products, and/or dietary supplements should be considered for those on calorie-restricted diets for long-term weight loss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adults; caloric reduction; NHANES; nutrient adequacy; obesity; overweight; weight loss","calcium; folic acid; iron; magnesium; potassium; pyridoxine; retinol; retinol palmitate; zinc; adult; Article; body weight loss; caloric intake; caloric restriction; clinical practice guideline; controlled study; diet restriction; dietary supplement; female; fortified food; health survey; human; male; nutrient availability; obesity; practice guideline; United States; middle aged; nutrient; nutrition; nutritional status; young adult; Adult; Caloric Restriction; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrients; Nutrition Surveys; Nutritional Status; Obesity; Overweight; Young Adult","","calcium, 7440-70-2, 14092-94-5; folic acid, 59-30-3, 6484-89-5; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; magnesium, 7439-95-4; potassium, 7440-09-7; pyridoxine, 12001-77-3, 58-56-0, 65-23-6, 8059-24-3; retinol, 68-26-8, 82445-97-4; retinol palmitate, 79-81-2; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6","This work was funded by Abbott Laboratories.","undefined; Curry, Susan J., Behavioral weight loss interventions to prevent obesity-relatedmorbidity and mortality in adults US preventive services task force recommendation statement, JAMA, 320, 11, pp. 1163-1171, (2018); 3.

Methods: For this cross-sectional study, conducted from October 2019 to November 2021, 238 children aged 6 to 16 years with self-perceived short stature were enrolled. The primary outcomes of sleep patterns and the RDI were non-invasively collected at home using the LARGAN Health AI-Tech Sleep Apnea and Sleep Quality Examination System, which operates based on polygraphy. Additionally, various physiological parameters, including height, BMI, bone age, and IGF-1 levels, were measured to assess their associations with sleep patterns and RDI. Results: Significant age-related reductions were observed in both the total and deep sleep durations. Children aged 6–9 years averaged 8.5 ± 1.0 h of total sleep, which decreased to 8.1 ± 1.1 h in ages 10–11 and further to 7.5 ± 0.9 h in ages 12–16 (p < 0.0001). Deep sleep followed a similar pattern, decreasing from 4.4 ± 1.1 h in the youngest group to 3.3 ± 1.0 h in the oldest (p < 0.0001). Notably, girls experienced significantly longer deep sleep than boys, averaging 4.0 ± 1.2 h compared to 3.6 ± 1.2 h (p = 0.0153). In a multivariable regression analysis, age (beta = 4.89, p < 0.0001) and RDI (beta = −0.54, p = 0.0022) were significantly associated with body height. Age and deep sleep duration (beta = −0.02, p = 0.0371) were significantly associated with BMI. Conclusions: The results demonstrate significant age-related decreases in the total and deep sleep duration among children with self-perceived short stature, along with a notable association between RDI and body height and an association between deep sleep duration and BMI. These findings suggest that sleep disturbances in pediatric endocrine patients are intricately linked with physiological growth parameters. The identified correlations underline the importance of monitoring sleep patterns in this demographic to better understand the impact of endocrine disorders on developmental health. Further research is needed to explore interventions that could alleviate these sleep disturbances, thereby potentially improving outcomes for the affected children. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","children; home portable sleep detection device; precocious puberty; sleep","somatomedin C; adolescent; Article; body height; body mass; bone age; child; cross-sectional study; female; human; major clinical study; male; pediatric patient; polysomnography; precocious puberty; respiratory disturbance index; short stature; sleep apnea syndromes; sleep disorder; sleep pattern; sleep quality; sleep time; slow wave sleep","","somatomedin C, 67763-96-6","Special thanks to the grant support from the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital (CSH-2021-C-033 and CSH-2023-C-004).","Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation an Unmet Public Health Problem, (2006); Berry, Richard Barnett, AASM scoring manual updates for 2017 (version 2.4), Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 13, 5, pp. 665-666, (2017); Carskadon, Mary A., Normal Human Sleep: An Overview, pp. 13-23, (2005); Stanley, Neil, The physiology of sleep and the impact of ageing, European Urology, Supplements, 3, 6, pp. 17-23, (2005); Werner, Helene, Agreement rates between actigraphy, diary, and questionnaire for children's sleep patterns, Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 162, 4, pp. 350-358, (2008); Rundo, Jessica Vensel, Polysomnography, Handbook of Clinical Neurology, 160, pp. 381-392, (2019); Molnár, Viktória, Examination of the diaphragm in obstructive sleep apnea using ultrasound imaging, Sleep and Breathing, 26, 3, pp. 1333-1339, (2022); Isrn Neurol, (2012); Park, Kwang Suk, Smart technologies toward sleep monitoring at home, Biomedical Engineering Letters, 9, 1, pp. 73-85, (2019); Joosten, Koen F.M., How do we recognize the child with OSAS?, Pediatric Pulmonology, 52, 2, pp. 260-271, (2017)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20754418","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200737582"

Methods: A survey was conducted among members of the SIRM Lombardy. Radiologists’ attitudes were assessed comprehensively, covering satisfaction with AI-based tools, propensity for innovation, and optimism for the future. The questionnaire consisted of two sections: the first gathered demographic and professional information using categorical responses, while the second evaluated radiologists’ attitudes toward AI through Likert-type responses ranging from 1 to 5 (with 1 representing extremely negative attitudes, 3 indicating a neutral stance, and 5 reflecting extremely positive attitudes). Questionnaire refinement involved an iterative process with expert panels and a pilot phase to enhance consistency and eliminate redundancy. Exploratory data analysis employed descriptive statistics and visual assessment of Likert plots, supported by non-parametric tests for subgroup comparisons for a thorough analysis of specific emerging patterns. Results: The survey yielded 232 valid responses. The findings reveal a generally optimistic outlook on AI adoption, especially among young radiologist (<30) and seasoned professionals (>60, p<0.01). However, while 36.2 % (84 out 232) of subjects reported daily use of AI-based tools, only a third considered their contribution decisive (30 %, 25 out of 84). AI literacy varied, with a notable proportion feeling inadequately informed (36 %, 84 out of 232), particularly among younger radiologists (46 %, p < 0.01). Positive attitudes towards the potential of AI to improve detection, characterization of anomalies and reduce workload (positive answers > 80 %) and were consistent across subgroups. Radiologists’ opinions were more skeptical about the role of AI in enhancing decision-making processes, including the choice of further investigation, and in personalized medicine in general. Overall, respondents recognized AI's significant impact on the radiology profession, viewing it as an opportunity (61 %, 141 out of 232) rather than a threat (18 %, 42 out of 232), with a majority expressing belief in AI's relevance to future radiologists’ career choices (60 %, 139 out of 232). However, there were some concerns, particularly among breast radiologists (20 of 232 responders), regarding the potential impact of AI on the profession. Eighty-four percent of the respondents consider the final assessment by the radiologist still to be essential. Conclusion: Our results indicate an overall positive attitude towards the adoption of AI in radiology, though this is moderated by concerns regarding training and practical efficacy. Addressing AI literacy gaps, especially among younger radiologists, is essential. Furthermore, proactively adapting to technological advancements is crucial to fully leverage AI's potential benefits. Despite the generally positive outlook among radiologists, there remains significant work to be done to enhance the integration and widespread use of AI tools in clinical practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; Artificial Intelligence; Automatic detection; CAD; Radiologists perceptions","adult; article; artificial intelligence; clinical practice; decision making; diagnosis; human; major clinical study; nonparametric test; normal human; optimism; perception; personalized medicine; pilot study; questionnaire; radiologist; workload; aged; female; health personnel attitude; Italy; male; middle aged; psychology; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radiologists; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","This study was supported by local research funds of CDI Centro Diagnostico Italiano S.p.A., an Italian Clinical Diagnostic Center.","Pesapane, Filippo, Artificial intelligence in medical imaging: threat or opportunity?

Data: The review incorporated publications on clinical diagnosis, patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials, cohort studies, and case reports that included individuals below 19 years of age with non-syndromic AI. Sources: A literature search was conducted across electronic databases, PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL, including papers published between 2017 and 2023. The search yielded 335 unique results, of which 38 were eligible for inclusion. Results: New evidence on the genetic background of AI makes it now advisable to recommend genetic testing to supplement a clinical AI diagnosis. The discussions of the dental profession and the public on social media do not always incorporate recent scientific evidence. Interview studies are finding that the impact of AI on quality of life is more severe than previously appreciated. New evidence suggests that single-tooth ceramic crowns should be the first choice of treatment. Due to incomplete reporting, case reports have been of limited value. Conclusion: In young patients with AI symptoms of pain and hypersensitivity decreased, and aesthetics were improved following all types of restorative therapy. Resin composite restorations were mainly performed in cases with hypoplastic AI and mild symptoms. Single tooth ceramic crown restorations have a high success rate in all types of AI and can be used in young individuals with AI. Clinical significance: Prosthetic rehabilitation in adolescents with severe AI is cost effective, improves esthetics, reduces tooth sensitivity, and improves oral health-related quality of life. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceramic crowns; Enamel; Genetic testing; Quality of life; Resin composite; Social media","resin; adolescent; amelogenesis imperfecta; child; dental procedure; dental restoration; diagnosis; genetic screening; human; procedures; quality of life; therapy; tooth crown; Adolescent; Amelogenesis Imperfecta; Child; Composite Resins; Crowns; Dental Restoration, Permanent; Esthetics, Dental; Genetic Testing; Humans; Quality of Life","","Composite Resins","","Aldred, Michael J., Amelogenesis imperfecta: A classification and catalogue for the 21st century, Oral Diseases, 9, 1, pp. 19-23, (2003); Bäckman, Birgitta, Amelogenesis imperfecta: prevalence and incidence in a northern Swedish county, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology, 14, 1, pp. 43-47, (1986); Witkop, Carl J., Hereditary defects in enamel and dentin, Human Heredity, 7, 1, pp. 236-239, (1957); Aldred, Michael J., It's only teeth - Are there limits to genetic testing?, Clinical Genetics, 63, 5, pp. 333-339, (2003); Coffield, Kristina D., The psychosocial impact of developmental dental defects in people with hereditary amelogenesis imperfecta, Journal of the American Dental Association, 136, 5, pp. 620-630, (2005); Pousette Lundgren, Gunilla, Oral health-related quality of life before and after crown therapy in young patients with amelogenesis imperfecta, Health and Quality of Life Outcomes, 13, 1, (2015); Pousette Lundgren, Gunilla, Amelogenesis imperfecta and early restorative crown therapy: An interview study with adolescents and young adults on their experiences, PLOS ONE, 11, 6, (2016); McDonald, S.

Data from two qualitative subsamples (N = 46) and parent surveys (N = 110) were analyzed, focusing on factors that affect sleep health behaviors, including parental involvement, technology, and traditional practices. Results: Key findings include the detrimental impact of electronics use at night and protective effects of traditional practices on sleep. Parental involvement in sleep routines varied by adolescent's age. Adolescents desired sleep health education in interactive formats, whereas parents preferred workshops and digital applications for sleep health strategies. Findings suggest that interventions need to address electronics use and should also be culturally tailored to address the unique experiences of urban AI/AN adolescents. Conclusions: Results underscore the importance of utilizing community-based strategies to develop culturally tailored sleep interventions for underserved populations, specifically urban AI/AN adolescents. Integrating traditional practices with evidence-based sleep health strategies can provide a holistic approach to improving sleep and overall well-being. Parental education and involvement will be critical to the success of such interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cultural interventions; electronics use; parental involvement; sleep health; urban AI/AN adolescents","adolescent; adult; age; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; bedtime; child; clinical article; controlled study; cultural factor; cultural sensitivity; family relation; female; health behavior; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; parental attitude; participatory research; personal experience; protection; sleep; sleep disorder; sleep environment; sleep pattern; sleep quality; social interaction; urban population; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Alaska Natives; Child; Community-Based Participatory Research; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Sleep; Urban Population; Young Adult","","","The authors would like to thank all study participants, their family members, our community partners, and our Elder Advisory Board.

The study investigates the impact of Chatbot-Assisted Self Assessment (CASA) on the intentions for sexual health screening within minoritised ethnic groups (MEGs) at risk of STIs as well as the subsequent use of a chatbot for booking STI screening. Methods: A simulation within-subject design was utilised to evaluate the effect of CASA on intentions for STI/HIV screening, concern about STIs, and attitudes towards STI screening. Screening intentions served as the dependent variable, while demographic and behavioural factors related to STI/HIV risk were the independent variables. ANCOVA tests were conducted to measure the impact of CASA on these perceptions. Results: Involving 548 participants (54% women, 66% black, average age = 30 years), the study found that CASA positively influenced screening intentions t(547) = -10.3, P < 0.001], concerns about STIs t(544) = -4.96, P < 0.001, and attitudes towards sexual health screening [t(543) = -4.36, P < 0.001. Positive attitudes towards CASA were observed (mean, 13.30; s.d., 6.73; range, -17 to 21). About 72% of users who booked STI screening appointments via chatbot were from MEGs. Conclusion: CASA increased motivations for STI screening intentions among ethnically diverse communities. The intervention's non-judgemental nature and the chatbot's ability to emulate sexual history-taking were critical in fostering an environment conducive to behavioural intention change. The study's high acceptability indicates the potential for broader application in digital health interventions. However, the limitation of not tracking actual post-intervention behaviour warrants further investigation into CASA's real-world efficacy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; artificial intelligence; behaviour change; chatbot; natural language processing; risk assessment; self-assessment; sexual health; sexually transmitted disease; sexually transmitted infections; virtual assistant","adult; analysis of covariance; anamnesis; Article; attitude to health; behavior change; Black person; chatbot assisted self assessment; cohort analysis; demographics; digital health; ethnic group; female; health behavior; health disparity; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; male; mass screening; minority group; motivation; natural language processing; program acceptability; risk assessment; self evaluation; sexual health; sexually transmitted disease; treatment outcome; young adult; behavior; diagnosis; ethnicity; ethnology; prevention and control; psychology; Adult; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Mass Screening; Sexual Health; Sexually Transmitted Diseases","","","Funding text 1: This report is independent research funded by NHS AI Lab and The Health Foundation and it is managed by the National Institute for Health Research (AI_HI200028).

It makes it possible to understand the spread of pathogens, but also to compare intervention scenarios even in counterfactual situations. However, the actual capability of decision makers to use mechanistic models to support timely interventions is limited. This study demonstrates how artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can make mechanistic epidemiological models more accessible to farmers and veterinarians, and how to transform such models into user-friendly decision-support tools (DST). By leveraging knowledge representation methods, such as the textual formalization of model components through a domain-specific language (DSL), the co-design of mechanistic models and DST becomes more efficient and collaborative. This facilitates the integration of explicit expert knowledge and practical insights into the modeling process. Furthermore, the utilization of AI and software engineering enables the automation of web application generation based on existing mechanistic models. This automation simplifies the development of DST, as tool designers can focus on identifying users' needs and specifying expected features and meaningful presentations of outcomes, instead of wasting time in writing code to wrap models into web apps. To illustrate the practical application of this approach, we consider the example of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), a tough challenge in fattening farms where young beef bulls often develop BRD shortly after being allocated into pens. BRD is a multi-factorial, multi-pathogen disease that is difficult to anticipate and control, often resulting in the massive use of antimicrobials to mitigate its impact on animal health, welfare, and economic losses. The DST developed from an existing mechanistic BRD model empowers users, including farmers and veterinarians, to customize scenarios based on their specific farm conditions. It enables them to anticipate the effects of various pathogens, compare the epidemiological and economic outcomes associated with different farming practices, and decide how to balance the reduction of disease impact and the reduction of antimicrobial usage (AMU). The generic method presented in this article illustrates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering methods to enhance the co-creation of DST based on mechanistic models in veterinary epidemiology. The corresponding pipeline is distributed as an open-source software. By leveraging these advancements, this research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and the practical usage of their outcomes on the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Code generation; Decision-support tools; Domain-specific language; Epidemiological modeling; Intervention ranking; Knowledge representation","antiinfective agent; agricultural worker; animal health; animal welfare; Article; artificial intelligence; decision support system; economic aspect; engineering; epidemiological model; integration; knowledge; nonhuman; software; theoretical model; veterinarian; animal; bovine; cattle disease; epidemiology; prevention and control; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Decision Support Techniques; Software","","","This work was carried out with the financial support of INRAE, Partnerships and Innovation Transfer Division (ATOM project) and with a grant of the Carnot institute France Futur \u00C9levage (project SEPTIME).

This study sought to determine whether generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based simulations of physicians making life-and-death decisions in a resource-scarce environment would demonstrate bias. Thirteen questions were developed that simulated physicians treating patients in resource-limited environments. Through a random sampling of simulated physicians using OpenAI's generative pretrained transformer (GPT-4), physicians were tasked with choosing only 1 patient to save owing to limited resources. This simulation was repeated 1000 times per question, representing 1000 unique physicians and patients each. Patients and physicians spanned a variety of demographic characteristics. All patients had similar a priori likelihood of surviving the acute illness. Overall, simulated physicians consistently demonstrated racial, gender, age, political affiliation, and sexual orientation bias in clinical decision-making. Across all demographic characteristics, physicians most frequently favored patients with similar demographic characteristics as themselves, with most pairwise comparisons showing statistical significance (P<.05). Nondescript physicians favored White, male, and young demographic characteristics. The male doctor gravitated toward the male, White, and young, whereas the female doctor typically preferred female, young, and White patients. In addition to saving patients with their own political affiliation, Democratic physicians favored Black and female patients, whereas Republicans preferred White and male demographic characteristics. Heterosexual and gay/lesbian physicians frequently saved patients of similar sexual orientation. Overall, publicly available chatbot LLMs demonstrate significant biases, which may negatively impact patient outcomes if used to support clinical care decisions without appropriate precautions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","undefined; Stokel-Walker, Chris, What ChatGPT and generative AI mean for science, Nature, 614, 7947, pp. 214-216, (2023); Harris, Emily, Large Language Models Answer Medical Questions Accurately, but Can't Match Clinicians' Knowledge, JAMA, 330, 9, pp. 792-794, (2023); Lee, Peter, Benefits, Limits, and Risks of GPT-4 as an AI Chatbot for Medicine., New England Journal of Medicine, 388, 13, pp. 1233-1239, (2023); Omiye, Jesutofunmi A., Large language models propagate race-based medicine, npj Digital Medicine, 6, 1, (2023); Balakrishnan, Karthik, The Impact of Cognitive and Implicit Bias on Patient Safety and Quality, Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America, 52, 1, pp. 35-46, (2019); Zestcott, Colin A., Examining the presence, consequences, and reduction of implicit bias in health care: A narrative review, Group Processes and Intergroup Relations, 19, 4, pp. 528-542, (2016); FitzGerald, Chloë, Implicit bias in healthcare professionals: A systematic review, BMC Medical Ethics, 18, 1, (2017); Hirsh, Adam Todd, The interaction of patient race, provider bias, and clinical ambiguity on pain management decisions, Journal of Pain, 16, 6, pp. 558-568, (2015)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","29497612","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198118718"

This study sought to investigate the perceptions of a sample of Australian radiography students regarding AI within the context of medical imaging. Methods: Radiography students completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire which obtained quantitative and qualitative data relating to their perceptions and attitudes of AI within the radiographic context. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilised, and thematic analysis was undertaken for open-text responses. Results: Responses were gathered from twenty-five participants, in their second, third and fourth year of study. Most participants demonstrated a positive attitude towards AI. Most students view AI to be an assistive tool, though the cohort was less convinced AI would increase future employment in the industry. Females were more likely to disagree that AI will increase work opportunities for the radiographer (p = 0.021), as well as those in their final year of study (p = 0.011). Perceived benefits of AI related to improved work efficiency and image quality. Negative perceptions of AI involved reduced job security, and potential impact on patient care and safety. Discussion: Students presented a multitude of positive and negative perceptions towards the role that AI may play in their future careers. Education pertaining to AI is central to transforming future clinical practice, and it is encouraging that undergraduate students are intrigued and willing to learn about AI in the radiographic context. Conclusion: This study offers insight into the current perspectives of Australian radiography students on AI within medical imaging, to assist in implementation of future AI-related education in the undergraduate setting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Attitude; Diagnostic Imaging; Radiography; Students; Universities","adult; article; artificial intelligence; attitude; career; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; employment; female; human; image quality; job security; male; patient care; perception; questionnaire; radiographer; radiography; thematic analysis; undergraduate student; Australia; education; health personnel attitude; medical student; psychology; radiology; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Radiology; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology, Radiologic; Young Adult","","","Funding: This study did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.","Ohene-Botwe, Benard, The integration of artificial intelligence in medical imaging practice: Perspectives of African radiographers, Radiography, 27, 3, pp. 861-866, (2021); Hardy, Maryann L., Artificial intelligence in diagnostic imaging: Impact on the radiography profession, British Journal of Radiology, 93, 1108, (2020); Iliashenko, Oksana Yu, Opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence in healthcare, E3S Web of Conferences, 110, (2019); Hosny, Ahmed, Artificial intelligence in radiology, Nature Reviews Cancer, 18, 8, pp. 500-510, (2018); Coakley, S., Radiographers’ knowledge, attitudes and expectations of artificial intelligence in medical imaging, Radiography, 28, 4, pp. 943-948, (2022); Odle, Teresa G., The AI era: The role of medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals, Radiologic Technology, 91, 4, pp. 391-400, (2020); Abuzaid, Mohamed Mahmoud, Assessment of the Willingness of Radiologists and Radiographers to Accept the Integration of Artificial Intelligence Into Radiology Practice, Academic Radiology, 29, 1, pp. 87-94, (2022); Yüzbaşıoğlu, Emir, Attitudes and perceptions of dental students towards artificial intelligence, Journal of Dental Education, 85, 1, pp. 60-68, (2021); Sit, Cherry, Attitudes and perceptions of UK medical students towards artificial intelligence and radiology: a multicentre survey, Insights into Imaging, 11, 1, (2020); Akudjedu, Theophilus N., Knowledge, perceptions, and expectations of Artificial intelligence in radiography practice: A global radiography workforce survey, Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences, 54, 1, pp. 104-116, (2023)","","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","19398654; 18767982","","","38403517","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186215685"

Methods: The AI tool with Bing.com/copilot, designed to generate Python code, uses data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to visualize trends and uncover insights in four key areas: (1) The prevalence of arthritis in adults aged 18 years and older who have diabetes, (2) The prevalence of fair or poor health in adults aged 18 years and older who have arthritis, (3) The prevalence of activity limitations due to arthritis in adults aged 18 years and older with doctor-diagnosed arthritis, (4) The prevalence of arthritis in adults aged 18 years and older who are obese. This research did not require approval from an institutional review board or an ethics committee. Results: The findings reveal a significant decline in the prevalence of arthritis among adults with conditions such as diabetes and obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also an observed improvement in activity limitations among patients with doctor-diagnosed arthritis. Conclusion: The study highlights the potential impact of the pandemic on chronic disease management, particularly arthritis. It underscores the importance of continued monitoring and care for patients with arthritis, especially during a global health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Addressing this bias is crucial given the urgent need for AI diagnostics facing rapidly spreading infectious diseases like COVID-19. We find the prevalent AI diagnostic models show an underdiagnosis rate among specific patient populations, and the underdiagnosis rate is higher in some intersectional specific patient populations (for example, females aged 20–40 years). Additionally, we find training AI models on heterogeneous datasets (positive and negative samples from different datasets) may lead to poor model generalization. The model's classification performance varies significantly across test sets, with the accuracy of the better performance being over 40% higher than that of the poor performance.

Data of patients from a health care area in Madrid (Spain) with diarrhea and positive-real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were collected. The periods analyzed were prepandemic (P0, April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020), first (P1, April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), and second (P2, April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022) pandemic years. We compared the prevalence, median age, patient profile, and absolute incidence (AI) per 100,000 population during the study periods using Fisher's test (p < 0.05). One thousand eighty-one (13.9%, [95% confidence interval, CI: 13.1-14.6]) of the 7793 patients tested during P0, 777 (13.3%, [95% CI: 12.4-14.2]) of the 5850 tested during P1, and 945 (12.4%, [95% CI: 11.7-13.2]) of the 7606 patients tested were positive for some BGIs. The global prevalence showed a decreasing trend that was statistically significant in P2. During P1, there was an increase in BGIs in the ED with a decrease of median age (p > 0.05). However, during P2, the prevalence for outpatients increased (p < 0.05). The individual prevalence analysis over the three periods remained homogeneous for most of the BGIs (p > 0.05). The AI of most BGIs showed a decreasing trend at P1 and P2 with respect to P0 (p > 0.05). However, Shigella spp./EIEC was the only BGI with a decrease in prevalence, and AI showed statistically significant variation in P1 and P2 (p < 0.05). The prevalence and AI for BGIs mostly showed a slight decrease during the first 2 pandemic years compared with the prepandemic may be explained by the greater impact of foodborne transmission on BGIs. The significant decrease in Shigella spp./EIEC illnesses could explain the mainly person-to-person transmission and the reduction of bacterial load in fomites for NPIs.

Twenty-four-hour dietary-recall data from NHANES 2013-2018 from 19,493 participants aged 9+ years were used to assess nutrient intakes. Nutritional adequacy was assessed by estimating the percentage of the population with intakes below the EAR or above the AI. A quartile trend was assessed using regression and the significance was set at Pquartile trend < 0.05. With increasing quartiles of plant protein, the adequacy decreased for calcium, potassium, and vitamin D and increased for copper and magnesium for adolescents. Among the adults aged 19-50 years, the adequacy decreased for protein, choline, selenium, vitamin B12, and zinc and increased for copper, folate, iron, magnesium, thiamin, and vitamin C with increasing quartiles of plant protein. The adequacy for calcium, vitamin A, and zinc decreased and it increased for copper, folate, magnesium, thiamin, and vitamin C with increasing quartiles of plant protein among adults aged 51+ years.

Although AI has been increasingly implemented in various fields of pharmacy, little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of pharmacy students and faculty members towards this technology. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to investigate the KAP of pharmacy students and faculty members regarding AI in six countries in the Middle East as well as to identify the predictive factors behind the understanding of the principles and practical applications of AI in healthcare processes. Material and methods This study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. A total of 875 pharmacy students and faculty members in the faculty of pharmacy in Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Libya participated in the study. Data was collected through an online electronic questionnaire. The data collected included information about socio-demographics, understanding of AI basic principles, participants’ attitudes toward AI, the participants’ AI practices. Results Most participants (92.6%) reported having heard of AI technology in their practice, but only a small proportion (39.5%) had a good understanding of its concepts. The overall level of knowledge about AI among the study participants was moderate, with the mean knowledge score being 42.3 ± 21.8 out of 100 and students having a significantly higher knowledge score than faculty members. The attitude towards AI among pharmacy students and faculty members was positive, but there were still concerns about the impact of AI on job security and patient safety. Pharmacy students and faculty members had limited experience using AI tools in their practice. The majority of respondents (96.2%) believed that AI could improve patient care and pharmacy services. However, only a minority (18.6%) reported having received education or training on AI technology. High income, a strong educational level and background, and previous experience with technologies were predictors of KAP toward using AI in pharmacy practice. Finally, there was a positive correlation between knowledge about AI and attitudes towards AI as well as a significant positive correlation between AI knowledge and overall KAP scores. Conclusion The findings suggest that while there is a growing awareness of AI technology among pharmacy professionals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, there are still significant gaps in understanding and adopting AI in pharmacy Practice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; Article; artificial intelligence; attitude; citizenship; clinical pharmacy; data quality; demographics; descriptive research; drug information; education; female; health care personnel; health service; hospital pharmacy; household income; human; internal consistency; job security; knowledge; Likert scale; male; Middle East; patient care; patient safety; perception; pharmacy practice; pharmacy student; quality control; questionnaire; reliability; sample size; social media; sociodemographics; training; young adult; attitude to health; cross-sectional study; health personnel attitude; Lebanon; pharmacy (shop); university; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Faculty; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pharmaceutical Services; Pharmacy; Students, Pharmacy","","","","Mak, Kit Kay, Artificial intelligence in drug development: present status and future prospects, Drug Discovery Today, 24, 3, pp. 773-780, (2019); Hassanzadeh, Parichehr, The significance of artificial intelligence in drug delivery system design, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 151-152, pp. 169-190, (2019); Bohr, Adam, The rise of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications, pp. 25-60, (2020); Future Healthc J, (2019); Paul, Debleena, Artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development, Drug Discovery Today, 26, 1, pp. 80-93, (2021); Brown, Nathan David, Artificial intelligence in chemistry and drug design, Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design, 34, 7, pp. 709-715, (2020); Colombo, Stefano, Applications of artificial intelligence in drug delivery and pharmaceutical development, pp. 85-116, (2020); Flynn, Allen J., Using artificial intelligence in health-system pharmacy practice: Finding new patterns that matter, American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy, 76, 9, pp. 622-627, (2019); Schwalbe, Nina R., Artificial intelligence and the future of global health, The Lancet, 395, 10236, pp. 1579-1586, (2020); Azhar, Saira S.Syed, The role of pharmacists in developing countries: The current scenario in Pakistan, Human Resources for Health, 7, (2009)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","38427639","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186315220"

Objective: In this systematic review, we investigated which individual, social and urban factors, experienced in early childhood, contribute to the development of later anxiety and depression, behavioural problems, and internalising and externalising symptoms in youth. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycInfo were searched on the 5th of January 2022. Three additional databases were retrieved from a mega-systematic review source that focused on the identification of both risk and protective indicators for the onset and maintenance of prospective depressive, anxiety and substance use disorders. A total of 46,450 records were identified and screened in ASReview, an AI-aided systematic review tool. We included studies with experimental, quasi-experimental, prospective and longitudinal study designs, while studies that focused on biological and genetical factors, were excluded. Results: Twenty studies were included. The majority of studies explored individual-level risk factors (N = 16). Eleven studies also explored social risk factors and three studied urban risk factors. We found evidence for early predictors relating to later psychopathology measures (i.e., anxiety and depression, behavioural problems, and internalising and externalising symptoms) in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. These were: parental psychopathology, exposure to parental physical and verbal violence and social and neighbourhood disadvantage. Conclusions: Very young children are exposed to a complex mix of risk factors, which operate at different levels and influence children at different time points. The urban environment appears to have an effect on psychopathology but it is understudied compared to individual-level factors. Moreover, we need more research exploring the interaction between individual, social and urban factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescence; adulthood; anxiety disorder; childhood; clinical feature; depression; exposure to violence; externalizing disorder; human; internalizing disorder; mental disease; neighborhood; physical violence; prediction; problem behavior; Review; risk factor; social aspect; systematic review; urban area; verbal hostility","","","This study was funded by the Bernard van Leer Foundation , which had no involvement in the study design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, and in writing the manuscript.","Zenodo, (2025); Bakoula, Chryssa Tzoumaka, Parental stress affects the emotions and behaviour of children up to adolescence: A Greek prospective, longitudinal study, Stress, 12, 6, pp. 486-498, (2009); Journal of Health Visiting, (2013); Barrios, Chelsey S., Stability and Predictive Validity of the Parent–Child Sleep Interactions Scale: A Longitudinal Study Among Preschoolers, Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 47, 3, pp. 382-396, (2018); Berry, Obianuju O., Social Determinants of Health: the Impact of Racism on Early Childhood Mental Health, Current Psychiatry Reports, 23, 5, (2021); Björkenstam, Emma, Childhood social adversity and risk of depressive symptoms in adolescence in a US national sample, Journal of Affective Disorders, 212, pp. 56-63, (2017); Braithwaite, Isobel, Air pollution (Particulate matter) exposure and associations with depression, anxiety, bipolar, psychosis and suicide risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Environmental Health Perspectives, 127, 12, (2019); Breedvelt, Josefien J.F., The effects of neighbourhood social cohesion on preventing depression and anxiety among adolescents and young adults: rapid review, BJPsych Open, 8, 4, (2022); Brinkhof, Lotte P., Assessing the degree of urbanisation using a single-item self-report measure: a validation study, International Journal of Environmental Health Research, 33, 5, pp. 508-517, (2023); Psyarxiv, (2022)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","23528273","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180107170"

Dunn's concept of wellness is a multi-dimensional aspect encompassing social and mental well-being. Neglecting these dimensions over time can have a negative impact on an individual's mental health. The manual efforts employed in in-person therapy sessions reveal that underlying factors of mental disturbance if triggered, may lead to severe mental health disorders. Objective: In our research, we introduce a fine-grained approach focused on identifying indicators of wellness dimensions and mark their presence in self-narrated human-writings on Reddit social media platform. Design and Method: We present the MULTIWD dataset, a curated collection comprising 3281 instances, as a specifically designed and annotated dataset that facilitates the identification of multiple wellness dimensions in Reddit posts. In our study, we introduce the task of identifying wellness dimensions and utilize state-of-the-art classifiers to solve this multi-label classification task. Results: Our findings highlights the best and comparative performance of fine-tuned large language models with fine-tuned BERT model. As such, we set BERT as a baseline model to tag wellness dimensions in a user-penned text with F1 score of 76.69. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the need of trustworthy and domain-specific knowledge infusion to develop more comprehensive and contextually-aware AI models for tagging and extracting wellness dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dataset; Mental health; Multi-label classification; Wellness dimensions","Domain Knowledge; Social networking (online); Dataset; Health disorders; Mental health; Multi dimensional; Multi-label classifications; Multi-labels; Social media; Underlying factors; Well being; Wellness dimension; Classification (of information); adult; Article; artificial intelligence; Asperger syndrome; classifier; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; health care utilization; human; large language model; mental disease; mental health; multilabel classification; social media; trustworthiness; wellbeing; young adult; awareness; Awareness; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Social Media","","","Funding text 1: This project was supported by NIH R01 AG068007.

MV has evolved significantly since its inception over 70 years ago and the future promises even more advanced technology. In the past, ventilation was provided manually, intermittently, and it was primarily used for resuscitation or as a last resort for patients with severe respiratory or cardiovascular failure. The earliest MV machines for prolonged ventilatory support and oxygenation were large and cumbersome. They required a significant amount of skills and expertise to operate. These early devices had limited capabilities, battery, power, safety features, alarms, and therefore these often caused harm to patients. Moreover, the physiology of MV was modified when mechanical ventilators moved from negative pressure to positive pressure mechanisms. Monitoring systems were also very limited and therefore the risks related to MV support were difficult to quantify, predict and timely detect for individual patients who were necessarily young with few comorbidities. Technology and devices designed to use tracheostomies versus endotracheal intubation evolved in the last century too and these are currently much more reliable. In the present, positive pressure MV is more sophisticated and widely used for extensive period of time. Modern ventilators use mostly positive pressure systems and are much smaller, more portable than their predecessors, and they are much easier to operate. They can also be programmed to provide different levels of support based on evolving physiological concepts allowing lung-protective ventilation. Monitoring systems are more sophisticated and knowledge related to the physiology of MV is improved. Patients are also more complex and elderly compared to the past. MV experts are informed about risks related to prolonged or aggressive ventilation modalities and settings. One of the most significant advances in MV has been protective lung ventilation, diaphragm protective ventilation including noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Health care professionals are familiar with the use of MV and in many countries, respiratory therapists have been trained for the exclusive purpose of providing safe and professional respiratory support to critically ill patients. Analgo-sedation drugs and techniques are improved, and more sedative drugs are available and this has an impact on recovery, weaning, and overall patients' outcome. Looking toward the future, MV is likely to continue to evolve and improve alongside monitoring techniques and sedatives. There is increasing precision in monitoring global ""patient-ventilator"" interactions: structure and analysis (asynchrony, desynchrony, etc). One area of development is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in ventilator technology. AI can be used to monitor patients in real-time, and it can predict when a patient is likely to experience respiratory distress. This allows medical professionals to intervene before a crisis occurs, improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for emergency intervention. This specific area of development is intended as ""personalized ventilation."" It involves tailoring the ventilator settings to the individual patient, based on their physiology and the specific condition they are being treated for. This approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes by optimizing ventilation and reducing the risk of harm. In conclusion, MV has come a long way since its inception, and it continues to play a critical role in anesthesia and in CCM settings. Advances in technology have made MV safer, more effective, affordable, and more widely available. As technology continues to improve, more advanced and personalized MV will become available, leading to better patients' outcomes and quality of life for those in need. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","sedative agent; artificial intelligence; artificial ventilation; assisted ventilation; comorbidity; critically ill patient; endotracheal intubation; human; negative pressure ventilation; noninvasive ventilation; oxygenation; positive pressure ventilation; protective ventilation; resuscitation; Review; tracheostomy; treatment outcome; aged; procedures; quality of life; ventilator weaning; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Quality of Life; Respiration, Artificial; Ventilator Weaning","","","","Baker, A.

It also addresses ethical aspects of integrating AI and other advanced technologies in these processes as well as the resulting implications. These issues include algorithmic fairness, privacy and surveillance, intellectual property rights, misinformation and violence, health concerns, and social implications. In addition, how access to such tools will impact the cognitive functions of their users, particularly learners, has become a relevant question. Much more information is now becoming easily accessible to a wider population, making it important to understand and mitigate AI ramifications to human learning, reasoning, and perception, especially for young learners whose brains are still in the early developmental stages. To that end, this paper also reviews the current literature regarding the impact of AI integration in education, focusing on the potential effects this can have on the cognitive abilities and functions of learners. Thus, with AI making its way into the educational realm, from pre-college to advanced studies levels, understanding the resulting pedagogical, psychological, and ethical ramifications can guide thoughtful development and appropriate integration of AI tools in support of the learning environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI ethics; Cognition; Learning; Regulation; Societal impact","Adversarial machine learning; Ethical aspects; Federated learning; Intellectual property; Self-supervised learning; AI ethic; Cognition; Cognitive functions; Ethical implications; Learning; Learning environments; Regulation; Societal impacts; Teaching and learning; Contrastive Learning","","","","Adiguzel, Tufan, Revolutionizing education with AI: Exploring the transformative potential of ChatGPT, Contemporary Educational Technology, 15, 3, (2023); Ali, Jamal Kaid Mohammed, The Impact of Online Learning amid COVID-19 Pandemic on Student Intrinsic Motivation and English Language Improvement, Dirasat: Human and Social Sciences, 49, 6, pp. 125-134, (2022); Bai, Long, ChatGPT: The cognitive effects on learning and memory, Brain-X, 1, 3, (2023); Education in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence AI Understanding the Potential Benefits of Chatgpt in Promoting Teaching and Learning, (2023); Bork, Poling Marianne, How video games may enhance students' learning and cognitive development, International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society, 8, 1, pp. 43-55, (2012); Buçinca, Zana, To Trust or to Think: Cognitive Forcing Functions Can Reduce Overreliance on AI in AI-assisted Decision-making, Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 5, CSCW1, (2021); Darvesh, Nazia, Exploring the prevalence of gaming disorder and Internet gaming disorder: A rapid scoping review, Systematic Reviews, 9, 1, (2020); Duch, Helena, Association of screen time use and language development in hispanic toddlers: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study, Clinical Pediatrics, 52, 9, pp. 857-865, (2013); Essien, Aniekan Emmanuel, The influence of AI text generators on critical thinking skills in UK business schools, Studies in Higher Education, 49, 5, pp. 865-882, (2024); Firat, Mehmet, What ChatGPT means for universities: Perceptions of scholars and students, Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching, 6, 1, pp. 57-63, (2023)","Goncalves, C.; Rouco, J.C.D.","Academic Conferences International Limited","","4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024","","Lisbon","205661","","9798331309466","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215679829"

Cognitive decline and loneliness are on the rise among older adults, which can have a negative impact on their health. According to Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, 44% of 1,080 suicides involved people aged 60 or older. This may be due to feelings of loneliness exacerbated by the recent wave of emigration leaving older family members behind. Added to this are the increasing mental health issues in young people and the older generation in Hong Kong. In light of these problems, we have developed an intergenerational reading program with generative AI to reconnect older adults and young people, aiming to strengthen bonding and understanding between the two generations. Based on this idea, we have created an intergenerational reading program involving older adults to participate in children book questions creation project using Socratic questioning. This is an active learning pedagogy that allows the learner to develop higher order thinking skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation (Gouges, 2012). Method Before designing questions in our reading program, older adults have attended workshops to learn about The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study reading assessment framework (PIRLS) with four levels (Information Retrieval, Inferences, Interpretation & Evaluation). The generative AI would assist the question creation process. The questions generated were published and participants entered a competition “Compete with Socrates” to assess the quality of questions. 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with older adult participants aged 60-70 individually to collect their feedback on the overall experience and the ways this program has affected them. Results and Discussion The data collected from the questionnaires would be utilized as the ground of our findings. Almost all participants reported a positive experience following the question generation activity. The impacts of this program on older participants were categorized into cognitive abilities, psychological well-being, and social connection. The majority of participants have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the structure and influence of this question generation activity. The program has been noted to have a positive impact on enhancing the cognitive abilities (e.g. to think more critically, solve problems creatively, and regulate their own learning). Although the program has brought about significant impact in improving the cognitive abilities and psychological well-being of participants, improvement may focus in building the social connection of participants. Afterall, social engagement is vital for combating loneliness and depression in older adults, promoting social support networks and interpersonal relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cognitive abilities; Intergenerational; PIRLS; psychological well-being; Socratic questioning","","","","","Multiple Literacies in the Technical Editing Classroom an Approach to Teaching, (2012)","","International Society for Gerontechnology","","","","","","15691101; 1569111X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206933043"

By leveraging popular eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), rule-based explanations, intrinsically interpretable models, and counterfactual explanations, we undertake an exploratory but in-depth examination of the impact of cannabis use on individual behavioral patterns and physiological states. This study explores the possibility of facilitating algorithmic decision-making by combining interpretable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques with sensor data, with the aim of providing researchers and clinicians with personalized analyses of cannabis intoxication behavior. SHAP analyzes the importance and quantifies the impact of specific factors such as environmental noise or heart rate, enabling clinicians to pinpoint influential behaviors and environmental conditions. SkopeRules simplify the understanding of cannabis use for a specific activity or environmental use. Decision trees provide a clear visualization of how factors interact to influence cannabis consumption. Counterfactual models help identify key changes in behaviors or conditions that may alter cannabis use outcomes, to guide effective individualized inter-vention strategies. This multidimensional analytical approach not only unveils changes in behavioral and physiological states after cannabis use, such as frequent fluctuations in activity states, nontraditional sleep patterns, and specific use habits at different times and places, but also highlights the significance of individual differences in responses to cannabis use. These insights carry profound implications for clinicians seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the diverse needs of their patients and for tailoring precisely targeted intervention strategies. Furthermore, our findings highlight the pivotal role that XAI technologies could play in enhancing the transparency and interpretability of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), with a particular focus on substance misuse treatment.

Snapchat’s My AI, tailored to its users, offers accessible and potentially stigma-free responses to sexual health queries, showing promise in addressing these gaps. This study aimed to evaluate My AI’s effectiveness in handling questions related to sexual communication, assault, and sexting, and its response consistency across users. Collaborating with young adults and leveraging prior literature, our team formulated questions on sexual consent, refusals, sexual assault, and sexting submitted to My AI by 15 researchers. Each team member opened a chat with My AI in Snapchat and asked it a set of questions in the same order. We then conducted a qualitative content analysis to assess for consistency across users. My AI responses emphasized the importance of clear, honest consent and refusal communication through physical contact or direct conversation. With potential experiences of sexual assault or sexting, it advised consultation with a trusted caregiver. While My AI provided similar responses across researchers, variations were noted. My AI’s responses mirrored common sexual health education messages and the responses used language reflective of sympathy toward potential assault victims or those who were asked for sexual images. My AI’s potential to enhance accessibility to sexual health information could empower young people in making informed sexual health decisions. However, variability in responses may limit impact and comprehension, underscoring the importance of educators complementing these tools. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","article; assault; caregiver; clinical article; consultation; content analysis; conversation; data analysis; female; health education; human; knowledge; large language model; medical information; sexting; sexual assault; sexual health; sexuality; social media; stigma; victim; young adult","","","","Affirmative Consent Campus Policy Report, (2017); Ayers, John W., Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum, JAMA Internal Medicine, 183, 6, pp. 589-596, (2023); Ayers, John W., Evaluating Artificial Intelligence Responses to Public Health Questions, JAMA Network Open, 6, 6, (2023); Barak, Azy, Toward an Internet-driven, theoretically-based, innovative approach to sex education, Journal of Sex Research, 38, 4, pp. 324-332, (2001); Brayboy, Lynae M., Girl Talk: A Smartphone Application to Teach Sexual Health Education to Adolescent Girls, Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, 30, 1, pp. 23-28, (2017); Cooper, Al, Sexuality and the internet: Surfing into the new millennium, Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 1, 2, pp. 187-193, (1998); Davis, Fred D.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Dolev-Cohen, Michal, Demystifying sexting: Adolescent sexting and its associations with parenting styles and sense of parental social control in Israel, Cyberpsychology, 14, 1, (2020); Döring, Nicola M., Consensual sexting among adolescents: Risk prevention through abstinence education or safer sexting?, Cyberpsychology, 8, 1, (2014); Singles in America, (2024)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","15598519; 00224499","","JSXRA","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203518231"

However, concerns have been raised about its factual accuracy and impact on health outcomes. To forecast implications for medical practice and public health, more information is needed on who uses the tool, how often, and for what. Objective: This study aims to characterize the reasons for and types of ChatGPT OHI use and describe the users most likely to engage with the platform. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, patients received invitations to participate via the ResearchMatch platform, a nonprofit affiliate of the National Institutes of Health. A web-based survey measured demographic characteristics, use of ChatGPT and other sources of OHI, experience characterization, and resultant health behaviors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Both 2-tailed t tests and Pearson chi-square tests were used to compare users of ChatGPT OHI to nonusers. Results: Of 2406 respondents, 21.5% (n=517) respondents reported using ChatGPT for OHI. ChatGPT users were younger than nonusers (32.8 vs 39.1 years, P< .001) with lower advanced degree attainment (BA or higher; 49.9% vs 67%, P< .001) and greater use of transient health care (ED and urgent care; P< .001). ChatGPT users were more avid consumers of general non-ChatGPT OHI (percentage of weekly or greater OHI seeking frequency in past 6 months, 28.2% vs 22.8%, P< .001). Around 39.3% (n=206) respondents endorsed using the platform for OHI 2-3 times weekly or more, and most sought the tool to determine if a consultation was required (47.4%, n=245) or to explore alternative treatment (46.2%, n=239). Use characterization was favorable as many believed ChatGPT to be just as or more useful than other OHIs (87.7%, n=429) and their doctor (81%, n=407). About one-third of respondents requested a referral (35.6%, n=184) or changed medications (31%, n=160) based on the information received from ChatGPT. As many users reported skepticism regarding the ChatGPT output (67.9%, n=336), most turned to their physicians (67.5%, n=349). Conclusions: This study underscores the significant role of AI-generated OHI in shaping health-seeking behaviors and the potential evolution of patient-provider interactions. Given the proclivity of these users to enact health behavior changes based on AI-generated content, there is an opportunity for physicians to guide ChatGPT OHI users on an informed and examined use of the technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption; AI; AI-generated; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; chi-square test; chi-square tests; cross-sectional; decision-making; descriptive statistics; diagnosis; experience; experiences; health information; health information; health literacy; health-seeking behavior; health-seeking behaviors; implication; implications; interaction; interactions; less-educated; medical practice; medical practices; non user; non users; online health information; patient; patient information-seeking; patient-provider; patients; poor health; public health; ResearchMatch; survey; surveys; t test; t tests; user; users; users; utilization; worse health","adult; Article; ChatGPT; cohort analysis; consultation; consumer; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; health behavior; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; medical information; national health organization; patient referral; personal experience; physician; pilot study; questionnaire; United States; aged; artificial intelligence; information seeking; middle aged; young adult; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the health care providers and community members who provided feedback and testing for this study including but not limited to: Olivia Campa MD (UC Davis), Ayodeji Ajibola MD (Kaiser Permanente Roseville), Elizabeth Burner MD MPH (Keck School of Medicine of USC), Adetokunbo Ajibola MSN, Madeline Stein BS (Antioch University), and Lauren Estess BS (Tufts School of Medicine).

Its 152,000 community reside in the Continental US and Puerto Rico, including those of all ages and races, both those in good health and those with health issues. ResearchMatch is supported by the US National Institutes of Health as part of the Clinical Translational Science Award program and is operated by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which maintains a large population of volunteers who have consented to be contacted by researchers about health studies for which they may be eligible. Participating health care systems around the country provide voluntary invitations for community members to join and make an account that allows for advertisements of available research studies. This population may preselect for a population with more dependable access to the internet such as White individuals with higher education and income. Platform moderators report that the majority of volunteers are female (69.1%, n=105,032), older than 18 years (97.2%, n=147,744), and White (70.6%, n=107,312) with 40.5% (n=61,560) volunteers reporting having no medical conditions. The platform allows researchers to specify cohorts prior to distribution by age, gender, race, health issue, and location. However, for the purpose of this study, the only parameters used were age to ensure adult participation only (\u226518 years) and selection of all 50 US States with the exclusion of Puerto Rico.

OM causes mild and moderate conductive hearing loss which can be disabling for young children, particularly during the first three years of life when brain growth is rapid, resulting in poor speech and language development, poor communication skills, and increased vulnerability on entering school. OM therefore contributes to the global burden of all-cause hearing loss. This systematic review seeks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of pre-trained Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including both classical Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), in the context of OM. This review proposes six research questions, and it summarizes the body of research across multiple domains, including the diversity and quantity of source material for training and testing models, including otoscopy images, videos, and tympanometry, and the methods used to assess quality and effectiveness in real-time settings. In addition, the review aims to provide insight into the impact and potential of AI in improving OM diagnosis and cast light on the existing challenges, such as model interpretability, limited medical expert involvement, and the need for knowledge discovery and unanswered questions, including the evolving landscape of OM diagnosis within this domain. The findings of this systematic review emphasize the importance of developing more interpretable AI models that incorporate both still images of the tympanic membrane and video recordings (with multiple frames) to maximize sensitivity and specificity of the model. In addition, collaboration with consumers and medical professionals in multiple specialties (general practice, pediatricians, audiologists and ear, nose, throat (ENT) surgeons) is needed to ensure applicability and confidence of these diagnostic digital support systems in real-world healthcare settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; datasets; ensemble model; Otitis media; otoscopy image; segmentation; tympanometry","Audition; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Personnel training; Radiography; Speech communication; Video recording; Auditory systems; Dataset; Ear; Ensemble learning; Ensemble models; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medium; Otitis media; Otoscopy image; Segmentation; Tympanometry; Video; Pediatrics","","","","Leach, Amanda Jane, Antibiotics for the prevention of acute and chronic suppurative otitis media in children, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 4, (2006); Joe, Hosung, A newly designed tympanostomy stent with TiO2 coating to reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation, Journal of Biomaterials Applications, 33, 4, pp. 599-605, (2018); Acute Otitis Media, (2020); Evidence Based Otitis Media, (1999); Williams, Cori J., The impact of otitis media on cognitive and educational outcomes, Medical Journal of Australia, 191, SUPPL. 9, pp. S69-S72, (2009); Hong, Oisaeng, Understanding and preventing noise-induced hearing loss, Disease-a-Month, 59, 4, pp. 110-118, (2013); Roberts, Joanne Erwick, Otitis media, hearing loss, and language learning controversies and current research, Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 25, 2, pp. 110-122, (2004); Casby, Michael W., Otitis Media and Language Development: A Meta-Analysis, American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, 10, 1, pp. 65-80, (2001); Davidoss, Nishant Hemanth, Animal models of acute otitis media – A review with practical implications for laboratory research, European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases, 135, 3, pp. 183-190, (2018); Pitaro, Jacob, Characteristics of children with refractory acute otitis media treated at the pediatric emergency department, International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology, 116, pp. 173-176, (2019)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199041227"

To analyze, the sentiment it trains the dataset used in the conversation which validates the prediction through a confusion matrix which resulted in test accuracy frequently correct is 70% for Transformer Bert and 68% in TextBlob. To test the usability of the chatbot and application, a survey was conducted on a group of 30 participants, using Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and Linkert scale, it showed that GPT-3 CUQ Mean is 77,71 higher than Deep Learning. As for the Linkert scale, it was verified that 68% of participants perceived that the chatbot was adequate to their concerns, as well that the acceptance rate was 90%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Chatbot; OpenAI; Sentimental Analysis; Transformers","COVID-19; Electric transformer testing; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Statistical tests; Chatbots; Generative model; Guayaquil; Mental disorders; Mental health; Neural-networks; Openai; Sentimental analyse; Social contacts; Transformer; Deep learning","","","","Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A., Perceptions and Opinions of Patients about Mental Health Chatbots: Scoping Review, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 23, 1, (2021); Microsoft Invests in and Partners with Openai to Support Us Building Beneficial Agi, (2019); Chen, Tao, Improving sentiment analysis via sentence type classification using BiLSTM-CRF and CNN, Expert Systems with Applications, 72, pp. 221-230, (2017); Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Hawton, Keith E., Self-harm and suicide in adolescents, The Lancet, 379, 9834, pp. 2373-2382, (2012); Chatbot Architecture Design Development Academia Accelerating the Worlds Research; Weizenbaum, Joseph, ELIZA-A computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine, Communications of the ACM, 9, 1, pp. 36-45, (1966); Kriegeskorte, Nikolaus, Neural network models and deep learning, Current Biology, 29, 7, pp. R231-R236, (2019); Multi Label Classifier Performance Evaluation with Confusion Matri; Larbi, Dillys, Usability Testing of a Social Media Chatbot for Increasing Physical Activity Behavior, Journal of Personalized Medicine, 12, 5, (2022)","Botto-Tobar, M.; Zambrano Vizuete, M.; Montes León, S.; Torres-Carrión, P.; Durakovic, B.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","5th International Conference on Applied Technologies, ICAT 2023","","Samborondon","312809","18650937; 18650929","9789819671748; 9789819664610; 9783032026743; 9783032008831; 9783032026712; 9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9789819666874; 9783031936968; 9783031941207","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195875986"

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) afford the opportunity to expand access to guideline-based nutritional support.METHODSAn AI-based nutrition assistant called Ina was developed on the basis of a learning data set of >100,000 expert-curated interventions, peer-reviewed literature, and clinical guidelines, and provides a conversational text message-based patient interface to guide dietary habits and answer questions. Ina was implemented nationally in partnership with 25 advocacy organizations. Data on demographics, patient-reported outcomes, and utilization were systematically collected.RESULTSBetween July 2019 and August 2023, 3,310 users from all 50 states registered to use Ina. Users were 73% female; median age was 57 (range, 18-91) years; most common cancer types were genitourinary (22%), breast (21%), gynecologic (19%), GI (14%), and lung (12%). Users were medically complex, with 50% reporting Stage III to IV disease, 37% with metastases, and 50% with 2+ chronic conditions. Nutritional challenges were highly prevalent: 58% had overweight/obese BMIs, 83% reported barriers to good nutrition, and 42% had food allergies/intolerances. Levels of engagement were high: 68% texted questions to Ina; 79% completed surveys; median user retention was 8.8 months; 94% were satisfied with the platform; and 98% found the guidance helpful. In an evaluation of outcomes, 84% used the advice to guide diet; 47% used recommended recipes, 82% felt the program improved quality of life (QoL), and 88% reported improved symptom management.CONCLUSIONImplementation of an evidence-based AI virtual dietitian is feasible and is reported by patients to be beneficial on diet, QoL, and symptom management.

Youth interventions are needed to support the prevention and reduction of substance misuse-related issues. Connecting AI/AN children to their heritage through culturally grounded prevention programs has been shown to be more effective than programs designed for the general population. The objective of this formative evaluation was to provide community-informed updates for an existing culturally grounded substance use prevention program, The Beauty Way. This study was conducted in partnership with an AI/AN-serving community organization using key informant interviews and talking circles with community members and parents. Participants revealed the challenges and obstacles AI/AN youth face, the impact of cultural values, and activities which engage youth to prevent problematic substance use. Recommendations include the importance of 1) incorporating current challenges to behavioral health such as social media and vaping, 2) including cultural values and activities including land-based learning, and 3) creating a robust facilitator guide and hiring culturally sensitive program staff. These results generated recommendations to strengthen the cultural focus and application of The Beauty Way for AI/AN youth. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; Alaska Native; American Indian; drug dependence; ethnology; female; human; male; prevention and control; transcultural care; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alaska Natives; Culturally Competent Care; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: Evaluation work reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R25DA031103.

We obtained our information by carrying out 11 737 visits to 1334 doe farms, 11 farms only with growers, and 23 artificial insemination (AI) centres. The median size of the visited doe farms was 450 does (minimum to maximum: 100-2500 does) and 1175 does (ranging from100 to 6000 does) in 1996 and 2022, respectively. AI was used on 9% of the farms visited in 1996 and 95% in 2022. For our diagnoses we used (1) clinical observations on all visited farms to detect sarcoptic mange; (2) examination of the outer ear of breeding rabbits on a subset of farms to assess the prevalence of otodectic clinical mange (OCM); and (3) the examination of breeding rabbits and youngstock does (2.5 to 5.5 mo old) on a subset of 72 farms during 2018 to estimate prevalence of body mange compatible with cheyletiellosis. They were mainly clinical diagnoses, supported sometimes by a laboratorial confirmation. Over the course of the 27-yr clinical study, the cumulative incidence of sarcoptic mange was low; we recorded a total of 13 affected doe farms. The percentage of farms affected by OCM dropped from 55% in 1996 to 28% in 2022. OCM mean prevalence for the period 1996-2022 and 95% binomial confidence interval (CI) were 3.2% (95% CI [3.1-3.3%]), and 3.9% (95% CI [3.7-4.1%]) in does and bucks, respectively. We observed an improvement over time; the OCM yearly mean prevalence decreased from 7% in 1996 to 2.3% in 2022 in females and from 7.2% to 2.2% in males, respectively. This progress was compatible with the use of semen coming from AI centres; biosecurity measures and medical management also contributed. Genetic type was predisposing risk factor for OCM. Enabling risk factors were year and season (more affected in summer). Hair and skin disorders along the back, compatible with cheyletiellosis, were also assessed during 2018; we detected 50% of positive farms with various prevalence results in females, males or young does. In this study, we describe protocols observed in the control of benign and severe cases of mange in rabbitries, which included the use of ivermectin and synthetic acaricides. Ivermectin was used on 36% of doe farms visited during 2018-2022; we suggest that it should be used less often to lower its negative impact on the environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","animal welfare; disease prevention; one health; rabbit mange","","","","","Arlian, Larry G., Infestivity of Psoroptes cuniculi in rabbits., American Journal of Veterinary Research, 42, 10, pp. 1782-1784, (1981); Arlian, Larry G., A review of Sarcoptes scabiei: Past, present and future, Parasites and Vectors, 10, 1, (2017); Domestic Animal Behaviour and Welfare, (2015); Bulliot, Christophe, A case of atypical psoroptic mange in a domestic rabbit, Journal of Exotic Pet Medicine, 22, 4, pp. 400-404, (2013); Cardells-Peris, Jesús, First description of sarcoptic mange in an Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis), Current Research in Parasitology and Vector-Borne Diseases, 1, (2021); Casáis, Rosa, Vaccination of rabbits with immunodominant antigens from Sarcoptes scabiei induced high levels of humoral responses and pro-inflammatory cytokines but confers limited protection, Parasites and Vectors, 9, 1, (2016); Prevalence Treatment Options and Risk Factors Associated with Mange in Central Kenya, (2020); Chiron, Pierre, FACTORS AFFECTING FRENCH RABBIT FARMERS' ADOPTION OF PRO-WELFARE INNOVATIONS, World Rabbit Science, 30, 4, pp. 249-265, (2022); World Rabbit Sci, (2001); Cohen, Steven R., Cheyletiella Dermatitis: A Mite Infestation of Rabbit, Cat, Dog, and Man, Archives of Dermatology, 116, 4, pp. 435-437, (1980)","","Universidad Politecnica de Valencia.","","","","","","19898886; 12575011","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189072199"

Traditional exercise prescriptions for mental health often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, which overlooks individual variations in mental and physical health. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to tailor these interventions more effectively. Objective: This study aims to develop and evaluate a multimodal data-driven AI system for personalized exercise prescriptions, targeting individuals with mental illnesses. By leveraging AI, the study seeks to overcome the limitations of conventional exercise regimens and improve adherence and mental health outcomes. Methods: The study is conducted in two phases. Initially, 1,000 participants will be recruited for AI model training and testing, with 800 forming the training set, augmented by 9,200 simulated samples generated by ChatGPT, and 200 as the testing set. Data annotation will be performed by experienced physicians from the Department of Mental Health at Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital. Subsequently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 40 participants will be conducted to compare the AI-driven exercise prescriptions against standard care. Assessments will be scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 months to evaluate cognitive, physical, and psychological outcomes. Expected outcomes: The AI-driven system is expected to demonstrate greater effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes compared to standard exercise prescriptions. Personalized exercise regimens, informed by comprehensive data analysis, are anticipated to enhance participant adherence and overall mental well-being. These outcomes could signify a paradigm shift in exercise prescription for mental health, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatment modalities.

When injured, the ability to fulfil an athletic masculine identity is threatened and athletes may experience injury fear-avoidance behaviours as part of a negative injury appraisal. The aim of the study was to explore whether higher athletic identity (AI) was associated with higher gender role conflict and injury-related fear-avoidance. Seventy-two male English academy footballers completed an Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), Gender Role Conflict Scale (GRCS), and Athlete Fear Avoidance Questionnaire (AFAQ) based on self-reported historical injuries. Correlational analyses were conducted for all variables, and a one-way ANOVA was used to compare high, moderate, and low AI. AIMS was significantly positively correlated with two GRCS subscales: success, power, and competition (SPC) and restricted affectionate behaviour between men (RAM). AIMS exclusivity also positively correlated with SPC and AIMS negative affectivity positively correlated with GRCS total and RAM. Additionally, the current study showed that high and moderate levels of AI had significantly higher levels of total GRCS than those with low AI. No significant results were found for AIMS, GRCS, and AFAQ. Results suggest that players with higher and more exclusive AI may be susceptible to masculine role conflicts, specifically, SPC and RAM, especially when there is a risk to their athletic role. The current study informs sport and health professionals of the need to monitor AI and masculine conformity in academy-level footballers to minimise gender-role conflict and potential maladaptive rehabilitation responses when their identities are threatened. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","masculinity; return to sport; sport psychology; sports medicine","adolescent; adult; athlete; avoidance behavior; England; fear; gender identity; human; injury; inner conflict; male; psychology; questionnaire; role conflict; sex role; soccer; sport injury; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Athletes; Athletic Injuries; Avoidance Learning; Conflict, Psychological; Fear; Gender Identity; Gender Role; Humans; Male; Role Conflict; Soccer; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Adams, Adi, Football friends: adolescent boys’ friendships inside an English professional football (soccer) academy, Soccer and Society, 20, 3, pp. 471-493, (2019); Anderson, Eric D., Orthodox and inclusive masculinity: Competing masculinities among heterosexual men in a feminized terrain, Sociological Perspectives, 48, 3, pp. 337-355, (2005); Asken, Breton Michael, Concussion-Like Symptom Reporting in Non-Concussed Collegiate Athletes, Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 32, 8, pp. 963-971, (2017); Bahr, Roald M., International Olympic Committee consensus statement: Methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 (including STROBE Extension for Sport Injury and Illness Surveillance (STROBE-SIIS)), British Journal of Sports Medicine, 54, 7, pp. 372-389, (2020); Benson, Alex J., Embracing athletic identity in the face of threat, Sport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology, 4, 4, pp. 303-315, (2015); Blazina, Chris, An adaptation of the gender role conflict scale for adolescents: Psychometric issues and correlates with psychological distress, Psychology of Men and Masculinity, 6, 1, pp. 39-45, (2005); Brewer, Britton W., Self-protective changes in athletic identity following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 11, 1, pp. 1-5, (2010); International Journal of Sport Psychology, (1993); Brown, Gavin, You've not made the grade, son': De-selection and identity disruption in elite level youth football, Soccer and Society, 10, 2, pp. 143-159, (2009); Clark, Ricketta H., A Systematic Review of Barriers and Facilitators for Concussion Reporting Behavior among Student Athletes, Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses, 26, 6, pp. 297-311, (2019)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","24734446; 24733938","","","37332231","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162191609"

This complicates timely diagnosis, therapy, and treatment. As a result, research into markers for depression and suicidal behavior continues. The use of artificial intelligence represents a significant advancement in suicide prevention, offering new tools for early detection and intervention to improve outcomes for at-risk individuals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 726,000 people commit suicide, not counting the much larger number of people who attempt suicide each year. Suicides occur throughout life, but in 2021 they became one of the leading causes of death among 15-29 year-olds worldwide. This problem is also relevant in Kazakhstan, and this article is the first to reflect an interdisciplinary approach to suicide prevention among minors using AI methods in application to scientific data obtained in the study of respondents with suicidal behavior. Suicide is a significant public health issue with profound societal impacts. Its effects extend beyond the loss of life, leading to emotional suffering for families and loved ones, and economic losses from reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs. For each suicide, there are over 30 attempted suicides, compounding the social and economic burden. The repercussions affect countless individuals, both directly and indirectly, leaving long-lasting emotional and financial strain. Additionally, the economic impact includes treatment costs for psychosomatic and mental disorders in those left behind, highlighting the extensive and multifaceted consequences of suicidal behavior. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","age-related ontogenesis; artificial intelligence; children and adolescents; machine learning; neural networks; risk factors; suicide prevention; young people","","","","This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Grant Funding 2024\u20132026 (Funder Project Reference: AP23490290 \""Development of a comprehensive system for the prevention of autodestructive and destructive behavior among the children's population of the Republic of Kazakhstan\"").

We developed an agent-based network model (ABNM) of 10,000 agents representing young Black men who have sex with men in the city of Chicago to examine the impact of varying degrees of post-incarceration care disruption and care engagement interventions following release from jail on HIV incidence. Methods: Exponential random graph models were used to model network formation and dissolution dynamics, and network dynamics and HIV care continuum engagement were varied according to incarceration status. Hypothetical interventions to improve post-release engagement in HIV care for individuals with incarceration (e.g., enhanced case management, linkage to housing and employment services) were compared to a control scenario with no change in HIV care engagement after release. Finding: HIV incidence at 10 years was 4.98 [95% simulation interval (SI): 4.87, 5.09 per 100 person-years (py)] in the model population overall; 5.58 (95% SI 5.38, 5.76 per 100 py) among those with history of incarceration, and 12.86 (95% SI 11.89, 13.73 per 100 py) among partners of agents recently released from incarceration. Sustained post-release HIV care for agents with HIV and experiencing recent incarceration resulted in a 46% reduction in HIV incidence among post-incarceration partners [incidence rate (IR) per 100 py = 5.72 (95% SI 5.19, 6.27) vs. 10.61 (95% SI 10.09, 11.24); incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.54; (95% SI 0.48, 0.60)] and a 19% reduction in HIV incidence in the population overall [(IR per 100 py = 3.89 (95% SI 3.81–3.99) vs. 4.83 (95% SI 4.73, 4.92); IRR = 0.81 (95% SI 0.78, 0.83)] compared to a scenario with no change in HIV care engagement from pre-to post-release. Interpretation: Developing effective and scalable interventions to increase HIV care engagement among individuals experiencing recent incarceration and their sexual partners is needed to reduce HIV transmission among Black men who have sex with men.

Methods: A single arm, naturalistic follow-up study aimed at assessing the acceptability and useability of the software. Patients had a baseline appointment, followed by a minimum of two appointments with the CDSS. Study exit questionnaires and interviews were conducted to assess perceived clinical utility, impact on patient-physician relationship, and understanding and trust. 7 physicians and 17 patients, of which 14 completed, consented to participate. Results: 86 % of physicians (6/7) felt the information provided by the CDSS provided more comprehensive understanding of patient situations. 71 % (5/7) felt the information was helpful. 86 % of physicians (6/7) reported the AI/predictive model was useful when deciding treatment. 62 % of patients (8/13) reported improved care due to the tool, and 46 %(6/13) reported a significantly or somewhat improved physician-patient relationship 54 % reported no change. 71 % of physicians (5/7) and 62 % of patients (8/13) rated trusting the tool. Limitations: Small sample size and treatment changes prior to CDSS introduction limits ability to verify impact on outcomes. Conclusions: Qualitative results from 12 patient exit interviews are analyzed and presented. Findings suggest physicians perceived the tool as useful in conducting appointments and used it while deciding treatment. Physicians and patients generally found the tool trustworthy, and it may have positive effects on physician-patient relationships.

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of RCL compared to a control group on items of condom and contraception self-efficacy. Linear regression analysis was used to compare differences in each item that included condom and contraception self-efficacy scales among the intervention and control participants at baseline, 3 and 9 months post intervention. Youth enrolled in the intervention reported higher levels of condom and contraception self-efficacy across almost all individual items. Exceptions include items related to partner negotiation of condom self-efficacy at 3 months (p = 0.227) and 9 months (p = 0.074) post intervention. Findings indicate RCL is effective at improving overall condom and contraception self-efficacy but did not impact the specific component of partner negotiation for either condom or contraception self-efficacy. This inquiry provides rationale to further explore components of RCL related to partner negotiation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian; Condom; Contraception; Prevention; RCT; Self-efficacy; Youth","adolescent; American Indian; attitude to health; child; contraception; contraceptive behavior; female; human; pregnancy; randomized controlled trial (topic); self concept; sexual behavior; young adult; Adolescent; American Indian or Alaska Native; Child; Condoms; Contraception; Contraception Behavior; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Self Efficacy; Sexual Behavior; Young Adult","","","This research was made possible by grant no.

Therefore, enacting suicide prevention efforts for AI/AN youth is especially important. Since research shows that strengthening social, cultural, and emotional support can reduce suicide risk, many recent prevention efforts focus on these strategies. Yet, to reinforce and to extend the positive impact of these strategies for suicide risk reduction, we argue it is useful to identify baseline levels and other features of already-existing support. Toward this end, we describe the types (i.e., category), quantities (i.e., distribution and average number), sources (i.e., from whom), and frequencies (i.e., how often) of social support that AN young people report receiving, and we examine if these “support profiles” differ by age and sex. We use survey data from 165 ANs under age 30, collected as part of a participatory intervention study focused on Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES). We find that: 1) most ANs reported receiving nearly all supports, 2) compared with females, males reported receiving fewer supports on average, 3) family was the most selected support source, followed by close friends and service providers, and 4) family (e.g., parents, siblings, and grandparents) provided support regularly (i.e., monthly or more). Though our findings may suggest fruitful avenues for interventions targeted toward AN males, we discuss these findings in relation to the gendered nature of suicide prevention and assessment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alaska Native; child/adolescent health; community-based participatory research; health disparities; mental health; social capital","adolescent; adult; female; human; male; questionnaire; suicide; suicide prevention; United States; violence; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Suicide; Suicide Prevention; Surveys and Questionnaires; Violence; Young Adult","","","This study was supported by the following grants: R01 MH112458, R34 MH096884, and P20 GM130461.","Beaudoin, Véronique, Protective factors in the inuit population of nunavut: A comparative study of people who died by suicide, people who attempted suicide, and people who never attempted suicide, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 1, (2018); Etudes Inuit Studies, (1990); Brown, Ryan Andrew, Cultural Identity Among Urban American Indian/Alaska Native Youth: Implications for Alcohol and Drug Use, Prevention Science, 17, 7, pp. 852-861, (2016); Bush, Aubrey, Social Support and Its Effects on Attempted Suicide Among American Indian/Alaska Native Youth in New Mexico, Archives of Suicide Research, 24, sup1, pp. 337-359, (2020); Castor, Mei Lin, A nationwide population-based study identifying health disparities between American Indians/Alaska Natives and the general populations living in select urban counties, American Journal of Public Health, 96, 8, pp. 1478-1484, (2006); Chandra, Anita, Stigma starts early: Gender differences in teen willingness to use mental health services, Journal of Adolescent Health, 38, 6, pp. 754-754.e8, (2006); Colarossi, Lisa G., Adolescent gender differences in social support: Structure, function, and provider type, Social Work Research, 25, 4, pp. 233-241, (2001); Collins, W.

No similar surveys have been conducted in Western Australia (WA) and it is not known how medical students in WA feel about the use of AI in healthcare or their understanding of AI. We aim to assess WA medical students' attitudes towards AI in general, AI in healthcare, and the inclusion of AI education in the medical curriculum. Methods A digital survey instrument was developed based on a review of available literature and consultation with subject matter experts. The survey was piloted with a group of medical students and refined based on their feedback. We then sent this anonymous digital survey to all medical students in WA (approximately 1539 students). Responses were open from the 7th of September 2021 to the 7th of November 2021. Students' categorical responses were qualitatively analysed, and free text comments from the survey were qualitatively analysed using open coding techniques. Results Overall, 134 students answered one or more questions (8.9% response rate). The majority of students (82.0%) were 20-29 years old, studying medicine as a postgraduate degree (77.6%), and had started clinical rotations (62.7%). Students were interested in AI (82.6%), self-reported having a basic understanding of AI (84.8%), but few agreed that they had an understanding of the basic computational principles of AI (33.3%) or the limitations of AI (46.2%). Most students (87.5%) had not received teaching in AI. The majority of students (58.6%) agreed that AI should be part of medical training and most (72.7%) wanted more teaching focusing on AI in medicine. Medical students appeared optimistic regarding the role of AI in medicine, with most (74.4%) agreeing with the statement that AI will improve medicine in general. The majority (56.6%) of medical students were not concerned about the impact of AI on their job security as a doctor. Students selected radiology (72.6%), pathology (58.2%), and medical administration (44.8%) as the specialties most likely to be impacted by AI, and psychiatry (61.2%), palliative care (48.5%), and obstetrics and gynaecology (41.0%) as the specialties least likely to be impacted by AI. Qualitative analysis of free text comments identified the use of AI as a tool, and that doctors will not be replaced as common themes. Conclusion Medical students in WA appear to be interested in AI. However, they have not received education about AI and do not feel they understand its basic computational principles or limitations. AI appears to be a current deficit in the medical curriculum in WA, and most students surveyed were supportive of its introduction. These results are consistent with previous surveys conducted internationally. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; article; artificial general intelligence; consultation; controlled study; curriculum; education; gynecology; human; human experiment; job security; major clinical study; medical education; medical student; obstetrics; palliative therapy; postgraduate student; psychiatry; qualitative analysis; radiology; rotation; Western Australia; artificial intelligence; attitude; Australia; female; health care delivery; pregnancy; young adult; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Obstetrics; Pregnancy; Students, Medical; Young Adult","","","","Trust in Artificial Intelligence Australian Insights, (2020); Global Attitudes Towards AI Machine Learning Automated Decision Making, (2020); AI for Social Good Australian Public Attitudes Toward AI and Society, (2020); Mazurowski, MacIej Andrzej, Artificial Intelligence May Cause a Significant Disruption to the Radiology Workforce, Journal of the American College of Radiology, 16, 8, pp. 1077-1082, (2019); Crigger, Elliott J., Trustworthy Augmented Intelligence in Health Care, Journal of Medical Systems, 46, 2, (2022); Hasan Sapci, A., Artificial intelligence education and tools for medical and health informatics students: Systematic review, JMIR Medical Education, 6, 1, (2020); McCoy, Liam G., What do medical students actually need to know about artificial intelligence?, npj Digital Medicine, 3, 1, (2020); Pucchio, Aidan A., Medical students need artificial intelligence and machine learning training, Nature Biotechnology, 39, 3, pp. 388-389, (2021); Katznelson, Gali, The need for health AI ethics in medical school education, Advances in Health Sciences Education, 26, 4, pp. 1447-1458, (2021); Pinto Dos Santos, Daniel, Medical students' attitude towards artificial intelligence: a multicentre survey, European Radiology, 29, 4, pp. 1640-1646, (2019)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","37651380","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169402410"

Radiation oncology has known tremendous technological advances in recent years, the latest being brought by artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the advantages brought by AI for segmentation, some concerns were raised by academics regarding the impact on young radiation oncologists’ training. A survey was thus conducted on young french radiation oncologists (ROs) by the SFjRO (Société Française des jeunes Radiothérapeutes Oncologues). Methodology: The SFjRO organizes regular webinars focusing on anatomical localization, discussing either segmentation or dosimetry. Completion of the survey was mandatory for registration to a dosimetry webinar dedicated to head and neck (H & N) cancers. The survey was generated in accordance with the CHERRIES guidelines. Quantitative data (e.g., time savings and correction needs) were not measured but determined among the propositions. Results: 117 young ROs from 35 different and mostly academic centers participated. Most centers were either already equipped with such solutions or planning to be equipped in the next two years. AI segmentation software was mostly useful for H & N cases. While for the definition of OARs, participants experienced a significant time gain using AI-proposed delineations, with almost 35% of the participants saving between 50–100% of the segmentation time, time gained for target volumes was significantly lower, with only 8.6% experiencing a 50–100% gain. Contours still needed to be thoroughly checked, especially target volumes for some, and edited. The majority of participants suggested that these tools should be integrated into the training so that future radiation oncologists do not neglect the importance of radioanatomy. Fully aware of this risk, up to one-third of them even suggested that AI tools should be reserved for senior physicians only. Conclusions: We believe this survey on automatic segmentation to be the first to focus on the perception of young radiation oncologists. Software developers should focus on enhancing the quality of proposed segmentations, while young radiation oncologists should become more acquainted with these tools. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; automatic segmentation; radiation oncology","academic cancer care facility; anatomical concepts; anatomical localization; Article; artificial intelligence; awareness; breast cancer; dosimetry; excitement; foreign student; France; head and neck cancer; health care facility; human; image segmentation; job experience; medical student; organs at risk; perception; physician; prostate cancer; radiation oncologist; segmentation time; thoracic cancer; time; university hospital","","","","Garibaldi, Cristina, Recent advances in radiation oncology, ecancermedicalscience, 11, (2017); López-Guerra, José Luis, New perspectives in radiation oncology: Young radiation oncologist point of view and challenges, Reports of Practical Oncology and Radiotherapy, 17, 5, pp. 251-254, (2012); Fiorino, Claudio, Technology-driven research for radiotherapy innovation, Molecular Oncology, 14, 7, pp. 1500-1513, (2020); Huynh, Elizabeth, Artificial intelligence in radiation oncology, Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, 17, 12, pp. 771-781, (2020); Deig, Christopher Ryan, Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America, 33, 6, pp. 1095-1104, (2019); Netherton, Tucker J., The Emergence of Artificial Intelligence within Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning, Oncology (Switzerland), 99, 2, pp. 124-134, (2021); Rattan, Rajit, Artificial intelligence in oncology, its scope and future prospects with specific reference to radiation oncology, BJR Open, 1, 1, (2019); Isensee, Fabian, nnU-Net: a self-configuring method for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation, Nature Methods, 18, 2, pp. 203-211, (2021); Kosmin, Michael A., Rapid advances in auto-segmentation of organs at risk and target volumes in head and neck cancer, Radiotherapy and Oncology, 135, pp. 130-140, (2019); Bibault, Jean Emmanuel, The French Society of Young Radiation Oncologists: History, goals and perspective, Reports of Practical Oncology and Radiotherapy, 17, 5, pp. 255-258, (2012)","","MDPI","","","","","","20726694","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152406638"

K., Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India; Rukmini, S., Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India","Our fascination with artificial intelligence (AI), robots and sentient machines has a long history, and references to such humanoids are present even in ancient myths and folklore. The advancements in digital and computational technology have turned this fascination into apprehension, with the machines often being depicted as a binary to the human. However, the recent domains of academic enquiry such as transhumanism and posthumanism have produced many a literature in the genre of science fiction (SF) that endeavours to alter this antagonistic notion of AI. In his novel Klara and the Sun, Kazuo Ishiguro explores this notion of AI as a caring machine capable of nursing an ailing young girl back to health. Through this portrayal of AI as a sentient being capable of empathy and cognition, Ishiguro is attempting to usher in a new perception of AI: a posthuman perception that challenges the conventional notions of AI as a machine devoid of emotions. The novel further expands on the idea of self, soul and human consciousness and ponders on the question, what makes humans human, and if it is possible to imbibe these qualities onto an AI. Owing to the novelty of this notion, an unexplored avenue that deserves further exploration, this paper examines the plausibility of this new notion of AI through a careful exegesis of the novel. The paper also attempts to chart the impact of SF in society and culture. The study reveals a positive shift in perception towards AI, and there seems to be much scope for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI; Posthuman subjectivity; Science fiction; Self; Society; Transhumanism","Intelligent robots; Computational technology; Digital technologies; Human consciousness; Intelligence robots; Positive shift; Posthuman subjectivity; Science fictions; Self; Society; Transhumanism; Behavioral research","","","","Alesich, Simone, Gendered Robots: Implications for Our Humanoid Future, IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 36, 2, pp. 50-59, (2017); Decoding Gender in Science Fiction, (2002); Dimensions of Science Fiction, (1986); Apple Podcasts, (2021); Dreams Our Stuff is Made of how Science Fiction Conquered the World, (1998); Critical Theory and Science Fiction, (2000); Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature Film and Popular Culture Reinventing Yesterdays Slave with Tomorrows Robot, (2017); Cyborg Handbook, (1995); Age of Wonders Exploring the World of Science Fiction, (1984); Christian Sci Monit, (2000)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09515666; 14355655","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133892766"

They have complex clinical phenotypes often associated with transnosographic dimensions, such as emotion dysregulation and executive dysfunction, that lead to adverse impacts in personal, social, academic, and occupational functioning. Strong overlap exists then across NDDs phenotypes that are challenging for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Recently, digital epidemiology uses the rapidly growing data streams from various devices to advance our understanding of health’s and disorders’ dynamics, both in individuals and the general population, once coupled with computational science. An alternative transdiagnostic approach using digital epidemiology may thus better help understanding brain functioning and hereby NDDs in the general population. Objective: The EPIDIA4Kids study aims to propose and evaluate in children, a new transdiagnostic approach for brain functioning examination, combining AI-based multimodality biometry and clinical e-assessments on an unmodified tablet. We will examine this digital epidemiology approach in an ecological context through data-driven methods to characterize cognition, emotion, and behavior, and ultimately the potential of transdiagnostic models of NDDs for children in real-life practice. Methods and analysis: The EPIDIA4Kids is an uncontrolled open-label study. 786 participants will be recruited and enrolled if eligible: they are (1) aged 7 to 12 years and (2) are French speaker/reader; (3) have no severe intellectual deficiencies. Legal representative and children will complete online demographic, psychosocial and health assessments. During the same visit, children will perform additionally a paper/pencil neuro-assessments followed by a 30-min gamified assessment on a touch-screen tablet. Multi-stream data including questionnaires, video, audio, digit-tracking, will be collected, and the resulting multimodality biometrics will be generated using machine- and deep-learning algorithms. The trial will start in March 2023 and is expected to end by December 2024. Discussion: We hypothesize that the biometrics and digital biomarkers will be capable of detecting early onset symptoms of neurodevelopment compared to paper-based screening while as or more accessible in real-life practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","biometry; child development; cognitive and behavioral performances; digital epidemiology; multidimensional assessment; neurodevelopmental disorders","biometry; brain; child; diagnostic imaging; human; mental disease; Biometry; Brain; Child; Humans; Mental Disorders","","","The study was funded partially by the bank of innovation (grant: DOS0180634/00) to O-Kidia.

With few exceptions, significant advances in prevention science have largely excluded this population, leaving gaps in the evidence of effective practice. This paper builds on emerging efforts to address this gap, reporting first outcome findings from an evidence-based early substance use prevention program culturally adapted for young adolescents on a Northern Plains reservation. Methods: Using a community-based participatory approach, the Thiwáhe Gluwáš’akapi Program (TG, sacred home in which family is made strong) was developed by embedding cultural kinship teachings within the Strengthening Families Program for Parents and Youth 10-14 and aligning other elements of program content with local culture and context. Results: Results of pre and post comparisons of proximal program outcomes showed that youth reported significant improvements in parental communication about substance use, substance use resistance skills, stress management, family cohesion, and overall well-being. Adults reported improvements in a wide array of parenting behaviors and indicators of family dynamics. Conclusions: These findings provide an initial glimpse into the potential effects of the TG program and suggest that it holds promise for helping AI families address risks for youth substance use through positive impacts on modifiable risk and protective factors documented to influence early substance use. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescence; American Indian; cultural adaptation; prevention; substance use","adolescence; adolescent; adult; American Indian; article; embedding; evidence based practice center; human; juvenile; outcome assessment; parental behavior; skill; stress management; substance use; teaching; wellbeing; child parent relation; drug dependence; interpersonal communication; Adolescent; Adult; American Indian or Alaska Native; Communication; Humans; Indians, North American; Parenting; Substance-Related Disorders","","","This work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse under Grant R01DA035111.","Allen, James, People Awakening: Collaborative Research to Develop Cultural Strategies for Prevention in Community Intervention, American Journal of Community Psychology, 54, 1-2, pp. 100-111, (2014); Allen, James, Multi-Level Cultural Intervention for the Prevention of Suicide and Alcohol Use Risk with Alaska Native Youth: a Nonrandomized Comparison of Treatment Intensity, Prevention Science, 19, 2, pp. 174-185, (2018); Monitoring the Future Questionnaire Responses from the Nation S High School Seniors, (1999); Barrera, Manuel, Cultural adaptations of behavioral health interventions: a progress report, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 81, 2, pp. 196-205, (2013); Beals, Janette, Lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in two American Indian reservation populations, Journal of Traumatic Stress, 26, 4, pp. 512-520, (2013); Beals, Janette, Racial Disparities in Alcohol Use: Comparison of 2 American Indian Reservation Populations with National Data, American Journal of Public Health, 93, 10, pp. 1683-1685, (2003); BigFoot, Dolores Subia, Honoring children, mending the circle: Cultural adaptation of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy for american indian and alaska native children, Journal of Clinical Psychology, 66, 8, pp. 847-856, (2010); Brockie, Teresa N., The Relationship of Adverse Childhood Experiences to PTSD, Depression, Poly-Drug Use and Suicide Attempt in Reservation-Based Native American Adolescents and Young Adults, American Journal of Community Psychology, 55, 3-4, pp. 411-421, (2015); Brody, Gene H., Family-centered program deters substance use, conduct problems, and depressive symptoms in black adolescents, Pediatrics, 129, 1, pp. 108-115, (2012); Cwik, Mary F., Exploring Risk and Protective Factors with a Community Sample of American Indian Adolescents Who Attempted Suicide, Archives of Suicide Research, 19, 2, pp. 172-189, (2015)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","10826084; 15322491","","SUMIF","37125477","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156172229"

During this period, the French national hotline for children in danger recorded a 56% increase in calls. Calls followed by an alert to departmental child protection services increased by 30%. Through an algorithm created by our team, we showed a 50% increase in the relative frequency of hospitalizations for physical abuse in children aged 0-5 years during the lockdown. This has fueled thinking about subsequent health measures to protect the youngest children. Our goal is now to use this algorithm for epidemiological purposes as a barometer of abuse or in daily practice to help the diagnosis of physical abuse in young children.; En France, au début de l'année 2020, environ 690 000 vies ont pu être épargnées grâce au confinement général de la population et aux mesures restrictives de lutte contre la Covid-19.

It is important to consider the young person as a whole, including reproductive health issues. This article proposes, through the principles of Beauchamps and Childress, an ethical reflection on the issues of beneficence - not maleficence, and of autonomy and justice for adolescents, young adults, and future trans or questioning parents. For adolescents, concerning the possibilities of medical treatment of gender affirmation, we need to propose information in terms of impact on fertility and, if necessary, proposals for the possibilities of preserving their reproductive capacities. These issues require to question the state of scientific knowledge in terms of parenthood of trans people and questioning. We propose here a state of knowledge of these realities, put in perspectives of the axes of ethical reflections inherent to guidance. In fine, it appears that the major ethical stake concerns the child to be born. Finally, it is necessary to consider the quality of life of the future parents and the impact of their medical follow-up.; L'accompagnement des enfants et des adolescents et adolescentes trans ou en questionnement ne peut faire l'économie d'une pensée éthique réflexive de sa propre pratique en tant que professionnel de santé. Il est important de considérer le jeune dans sa globalité, et cela également en ce qui concerne les enjeux en santé reproductive. Cet article propose, au travers des principes de Tom Beauchamps et James Childress1, une réflexion éthique des enjeux de bienfaisance/non nuisance, d'autonomie et de justice, pour les adolescents, jeunes adultes, et futurs parents trans ou en questionnement. Pour les adolescents et les adolescentes, autour des possibilités de traitement médical d'affirmation de genre, il est nécessaire de proposer des informations, en termes d'impact sur la fertilité et, le cas échéant, des propositions de possibilités de conservation de ses capacités reproductives. Ces enjeux nécessitent d'interroger l'état des connaissances scientifiques en termes de parentalité des personnes trans et en questionnement. Nous proposons ici un état des lieux des connaissances de ces réalités, mises en perspective des axes de réflexions éthiques inhérentes aux accompagnements. In fine, il apparaît que l'enjeu éthique majeur porte sur l'enfant aÌ naître.

Perceptions of AI are less well-known, notably amongst children and young people (CYP). This workshop investigates attitudes towards AI and its future applications in medicine and healthcare at a specialised paediatric hospital using practical design scenarios. Method: Twenty-one members of a Young Persons Advisory Group for research contributed to an engagement workshop to ascertain potential opportunities, apprehensions, and priorities. Results: When presented as a selection of practical design scenarios, we found that CYP were more open to some applications of AI in healthcare than others. Human-centeredness, governance and trust emerged as early themes, with empathy and safety considered as important when introducing AI to healthcare. Educational workshops with practical examples using AI to help, but not replace humans were suggested to address issues, build trust, and effectively communicate about AI. Conclusion: Whilst policy guidelines acknowledge the need to include children and young people to develop AI, this requires an enabling environment for human-centred AI involving children and young people with lived experiences of healthcare. Future research should focus on building consensus on enablers for an intelligent healthcare system designed for the next generation, which fundamentally, allows co-creation. Impact: Children and young people (CYP) want to be included to share their insights about the development of research on the potential role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine and healthcare and are more open to some applications of AI than others.Whilst it is acknowledged that a research gap on involving and engaging CYP in developing AI policies exists, there is little in the way of pragmatic and practical guidance for healthcare staff on this topic.This requires research on enabling environments for ongoing digital cooperation to identify and prioritise unmet needs in the application and development of AI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","article; artificial intelligence; child; clinical article; consensus; controlled study; empathy; female; health care system; human; human experiment; male; personal experience; practice guideline; trust; adolescent; health care delivery; medicine; problem solving; Adolescent; Artificial Intelligence; Child; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Medicine; Problem Solving","","","Funding text 1: SV acknowledges doctoral funding from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children Charities.; Funding text 2: We thank the twenty-one members of GOSH YPAG for their engagement in this PPEI workshop.

Consequently, many cancer patients are diagnosed late and outcomes are poor. Here, we propose to evaluate circulating tumour (ct) DNA analysis (“liquid biopsy”), a less invasive and faster approach to diagnose endemic EBV-driven lymphomas (EBVL) in East Africa. Methods: We will evaluate the clinical utility of an already validated ctDNA test prospectively in a head-to-head comparison against histopathology. The primary endpoint is the time from presentation to the specialist centre to a final diagnosis of EBV- Lymphoma. Secondary endpoints include the sensitivity and specificity of liquid biopsy and health economic benefits over histopathology. One hundred forty-six patients will be recruited over 18 months. Patients will be eligible if they are 3–30 years of age and have provided written consent or assent as per IRB guidelines. Tissue and venous blood samples will be processed as per established protocols. Clinical data will be captured securely and in real-time into a REDCap database. The time from presentation to diagnosis will be documented. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods can be estimated within 5% error margin with 95% confidence level using 73 cases and 73 controls. Health-economic assessment will include micro-costing of ctDNA test and histopathology. All results will be reviewed in a multidisciplinary tumour board. Discussion: The study evaluates the clinical utility of ctDNA in improving the speed of diagnostic pathways for EBVL in sub-Saharan Africa. Our results would provide proof-of-principle that ctDNA can be used as a diagnostic tool in areas without access to regular pathology, that transfer of the tool is feasible, and that it leads to an earlier and faster diagnosis. The potential clinical and economic impact of this proposal is thus significant. If successful, this study will provide appropriate, and cost-effective diagnostic tools that will promote earlier diagnosis of EBVL and potentially other cancers in countries with restricted healthcare resources.

However, factors influencing healthcare workers’ adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment are not well-understood. This study conducted a cross-sectional study of 343 dental healthcare workers from tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals in Anhui Province. The obtained data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that performance expectancy and effort expectancy were both positively related to healthcare workers’ adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Social influence and human–computer trust, respectively, mediated the relationship between expectancy (performance expectancy and effort expectancy) and healthcare workers’ adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, social influence and human–computer trust played a chain mediation role between expectancy and healthcare workers’ adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Our study provided novel insights into the path mechanism of healthcare workers’ adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adoption intention; AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment; effort expectancy; healthcare worker; human–computer trust; performance expectancy; social influence","artificial intelligence; computer; disease treatment; health worker; hospital sector; performance assessment; social impact; technology adoption; adult; Article; computer assisted diagnosis; conceptual framework; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; data analysis; dental personnel; female; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; job adaptation; job performance; male; middle aged; normal human; secondary care center; structural equation modeling; tertiary care center; trust; young adult; behavior; health care personnel; intelligence; Anhui; China; Artificial Intelligence; Computers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Personnel; Humans; Intelligence; Intention; Trust","","","This research was funded by the Anhui Education Humanities and Social Science Research Major Program (SK2020ZD18) and Anhui University of Science and Technology Innovation Fund Program (2021CX2133).","J Family Med Prim Care, (2025); Harvard Business Review, (2017); He, Jianxing, The practical implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in medicine, Nature Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 30-36, (2019); Huo, Weiwei, Interacting with medical artificial intelligence: Integrating self-responsibility attribution, human–computer trust, and personality, Computers in Human Behavior, 132, (2022); Vinod, Dasari Naga, Data science and the role of Artificial Intelligence in achieving the fast diagnosis of Covid-19, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 140, (2020); Chen, Yowei, Artificial intelligence in dentistry: Current applications and future perspectives, Quintessence International, 51, 3, pp. 248-257, (2020); Hung, Kuo Feng, The use and performance of artificial intelligence applications in dental and maxillofacial radiology: A systematic review, Dentomaxillofacial Radiology, 49, 1, (2019); Lee, Jae Hong, Detection and diagnosis of dental caries using a deep learning-based convolutional neural network algorithm, Journal of Dentistry, 77, pp. 106-111, (2018); Casalegno, Francesco, Caries Detection with Near-Infrared Transillumination Using Deep Learning, Journal of Dental Research, 98, 11, pp. 1227-1233, (2019); Holsinger, Floyd Christopher, A flexible, single-arm robotic surgical system for transoral resection of the tonsil and lateral pharyngeal wall: Next-generation robotic head and neck surgery, Laryngoscope, 126, 4, pp. 864-869, (2016)","","MDPI","","","","","","16604601; 16617827","","","36293889","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140904425"

The second aim was to assess the dietary habits of this population during a complete season. Fifteen elite male (age: 23.2 ± 5.4 years) and twenty-three elite female (age: 20.1 ± 7.0 years) cyclists volunteered to participate in the study. Dietary nutrient intake during pre-season was assessed using a 72 h dietary recall interview, and a 136-item food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary habits during the year. Protein intake exceeded the PRI’s recommendation of 0.83 g/kg/day for all cycling groups. Fat exceeded RI recommendations in females in both road (43.3%) and CXO (39.8%) cycling groups, whilst males were found to follow recommendations for fat intake. CHO intake was below recommendations in all groups. Intake of all vitamins exceeded recommendations, with the exception of B9 in female road cyclists (77.8% RDA) and vitamin D in all groups. With regards to mineral intake, consumption exceeded RDA/AI recommendations in all groups except for iodine in male XCO cyclists (61.6%), female road cyclists (61.6%), and female XCO cyclists (58%) and potassium in female road cyclists (74.6%). Males consumed greater amounts of eggs and non-processed foods than females. Road cyclists consumed greater amounts of fish and seafood and had a lower intake of coffee and tea than XCO cyclists.

Links between discrimination and sleep in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have not been established. Further, it is unclear if such links might depend on the timing of discrimination or if socioeconomic status (SES) might buffer the impact of discrimination. Purpose: To investigate associations between interpersonal discrimination and sleep impairment in urban AI/AN, for both lifetime and recent discrimination, and controlling for other life stressors. Education and income, indices of SES, were tested as potential moderators. Methods: A community sample of urban AI/AN (N = 303, 18-78 years old, 63% female) completed self-report measures of sleep impairment, lifetime and recent discrimination, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, other life stressors (childhood adversity and past year major events), and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Lifetime discrimination was associated with impaired sleep in AI/AN after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics, recent depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and other life stressors. Past-week discrimination was associated with sleep in unadjusted but not adjusted models. Education, but not income, was found to buffer the effects of both lifetime and past-week discrimination on sleep in adjusted models. Conclusion: Lifetime discrimination uniquely accounts for sleep impairment and may be especially harmful in those with less education. These findings suggest targeting interventions to those most in need. Limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data. Longitudinal and qualitative work is needed to understand how education may buffer the effects of discrimination on sleep and perhaps other health problems in AI/AN. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indians and Alaska Natives; Discrimination; Sleep impairment; Socioeconomic status","adolescent; adult; aged; Alaska Native; American Indian; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; middle aged; self report; sleep; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alaskan Natives; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Self Report; Sleep; Young Adult","","","","Cho, Pyone, Diabetes-related mortality among American Indians and Alaska natives, 1990û2009, American Journal of Public Health, 104, SUPPL. 3, pp. S496-S503, (2014); Steele, C.

The pandemic and its devastating implications have had a significant impact on higher education, as well as other sectors. Numerous researchers have utilized typical statistical methods to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological wellbeing of young people. Moreover, the primary aspects that have changed in the psychological condition of children and young adults during COVID lockdown is analyzed. These changes are analyzed using machine learning and AI techniques which should be established for the alterations. This research work mainly concentrates on children's and young people's mental health in the first lockdown. There are six processes involved in this work. Initially, it collects the data using questionnaires, and then, the collected data are pre-processed by data cleaning, categorical encoding, and data normalization method. Next, the clustering process is used for grouping the data based on their mood state, and then, the feature selection process is done by chi-square, L1-Norm, and ReliefF. Then, the machine learning classifiers are used for predicting the mood state, and automatic calibration is used for selecting the best model. Finally, it predicts the mood state of the children and young adults. The findings revealed that for a better understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and youths' mental states, a combination of heterogeneous data from practically all feature groups is required. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; clustering; COVID-19; feature selection; machine learning; mental health; mood state","","","","This work was supported by the Social Science Research Planning Project of Jiangxi Province, China, “The Influence of Moral Emotion on Online Helping Behavior of College Students” (19JY46).","Abas, Melanie, COVID-19 and global mental health, The Lancet Psychiatry, 8, 6, pp. 458-459, (2021); Anchang, Julius Y., An efficient unsupervised index based approach for mapping urban vegetation from IKONOS imagery, International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 50, pp. 211-220, (2016); Ansari, Javad, A joint energy and reserve scheduling framework based on network reliability using smart grids applications, International Transactions on Electrical Energy Systems, 29, 11, (2019); Arxiv Preprint Arxiv 2204 12346, (2022); Covid Economics, (2020); Chakraborty, Indranil, COVID-19 outbreak: Migration, effects on society, global environment and prevention, Science of the Total Environment, 728, (2020); Cost, Katherine Tombeau, Mostly worse, occasionally better: impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Canadian children and adolescents, European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 31, 4, pp. 671-684, (2022); Demir, Fatih, A Simple and Effective Approach Based on a Multi-Level Feature Selection for Automated Parkinson’s Disease Detection, Journal of Personalized Medicine, 12, 1, (2022); Demir, Fatih, A new pyramidal concatenated CNN approach for environmental sound classification, Applied Acoustics, 170, (2020); Garcia de Avila, Marla Andréia, Children’s anxiety and factors related to the covid-19 pandemic: An exploratory study using the children’s anxiety questionnaire and the numerical rating scale, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 16, pp. 1-13, (2020)","","Frontiers Media SA","","","","","","16641078","","","","English","Retracted","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136073635"

Through our established partnerships with schools in California and Kansas, we have developed educational tools to positively influence the learning and career paths of young high school (HS) students from underserved districts and underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Through the development of new curricula, teaching modules, and shared resources that are made broadly available to other school districts, this work has the potential to impact a large number of K-12 teachers and students. We have been working to train HS teachers to create connections between the STEM subjects they teach students with advanced topics, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that are often taught only post-HS. It creates a context where students can see how their STEM skills can be applied and a pathway of continuing STEM education from secondary to post-secondary. As a result, there is the potential to improve student interest and self-efficacy in STEM and to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Furthermore, AI is key to understanding and making use of data and solving many control problems. We aim to help students learn the fundamentals of how AI algorithms are applied in contemporary neuroscience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; biomedical control systems; Control education; databases; machine learning; medical applications; stochastic control","Curricula; Engineering education; Machine learning; Medical applications; Professional aspects; Stem cells; Stochastic systems; Biomedical control; Biomedical control system; Controls education; Engineering and mathematics; High school students; Machine-learning; Science education; Science technologies; Stochastic control; Technology education; Students","","","⋆This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Award Number 2027456 (COVID-ARC).","Statistics at A Glance, (2021); Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, (2021); Brouillette, Monique, AI added to the curriculum for doctors-to-be, Nature Medicine, 25, 12, pp. 1808-1809, (2019); Clabaugh, Caitlyn E., Long-Term Personalization of an In-Home Socially Assistive Robot for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders, Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 6, (2019); 2019 State of Computer Science Education, (2019); Deco, Gustavo Ricardo, Stochastic dynamics as a principle of brain function, Progress in Neurobiology, 88, 1, pp. 1-16, (2009); Journal of Education and Training Studies, (2017); Bayesian Brain Probabilistic Approaches to Neural Coding, (2007); Duncan, Dominique Tyrone E., COVID-19 data sharing and collaboration, Communications in Information and Systems, 21, 3, pp. 325-340, (2021); Evangelista, Ignacio, Why are we not teaching machine learning at high school?

This study will assess the feasibility and impact of integrating an artificial intelligence (AI)-based ASD diagnosis aid (the device) into the existing ECHO Autism Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (STAT) diagnosis model. The prescription-only Software as a Medical Device, designed for use in children aged 18 to 72 months at risk for developmental delay, produces ASD diagnostic recommendations after analyzing behavioral features from 3 distinct inputs: a caregiver questionnaire, 2 short home videos analyzed by trained video analysts, and a health care provider questionnaire. The device is not a stand-alone diagnostic and should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment. Objective: This study aims to assess the feasibility and impact of integrating an AI-based ASD diagnosis aid into the ECHO Autism STAT diagnosis model. The time from initial ECHO Autism clinician concern to ASD diagnosis is the primary end point. Secondary end points include the time from initial caregiver concern to ASD diagnosis, time from diagnosis to treatment initiation, and clinician and caregiver experience of device use as part of the ASD diagnostic journey. Methods: Research participants for this prospective observational study will be patients suspected of having ASD (aged 18-72 months) and their caregivers and up to 15 trained ECHO Autism clinicians recruited by the ECHO Autism Communities research team from across rural and suburban areas of the United States. Clinicians will provide routine clinical care and conduct best practice ECHO Autism diagnostic evaluations in addition to prescribing the device. Outcome data will be collected via a combination of electronic questionnaires, reviews of standard clinical care records, and analysis of device outputs. The expected study duration is no more than 12 months. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Missouri-Columbia (institutional review board-assigned project number 2075722). Results: Participant recruitment began in April 2022. As of June 2022, a total of 41 participants have been enrolled. Conclusions: This prospective observational study will be the first to evaluate the use of a novel AI-based ASD diagnosis aid as part of a real-world primary care diagnostic pathway. If device integration into primary care proves feasible and efficacious, prolonged delays between the first ASD concern and eventual diagnosis may be reduced. Streamlining primary care ASD diagnosis could potentially reduce the strain on specialty services and allow a greater proportion of children to commence early intervention during a critical neurodevelopmental window. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; autism spectrum disorder; diagnosis; machine learning; mobile phone; primary care; Software as a Medical Device","","","","This study is sponsored by Cognoa Inc.","Maenner, Matthew J., Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder Among Children Aged 8 Years — Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2018, MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 70, 11, pp. 1-16, (2021); Ben-Itzhak, Ester, Who benefits from early intervention in autism spectrum disorders?, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 5, 1, pp. 345-350, (2011); Flanagan, Helen E., Effectiveness of large-scale community-based Intensive Behavioral Intervention: A waitlist comparison study exploring outcomes and predictors, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 6, 2, pp. 673-682, (2012); Smith, Tristram H., Predicting Outcome of Community-Based Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for Children with Autism, Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 43, 7, pp. 1271-1282, (2015); Dawson, Geraldine, Randomized, controlled trial of an intervention for toddlers with autism: The early start Denver model, Pediatrics, 125, 1, pp. e17-e23, (2010); Baker-Ericzén, Mary J., Child demographics associated with outcomes in a community-based pivotal response training program, Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, 9, 1, pp. 52-60, (2007); Mazurek, Micah Osborne, Predicting improvement in social-communication symptoms of autism spectrum disorders using retrospective treatment data, Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders, 6, 1, pp. 535-545, (2012); MacDonald, Rebecca P.F., Assessing progress and outcome of early intensive behavioral intervention for toddlers with autism, Research in Developmental Disabilities, 35, 12, pp. 3632-3644, (2014); Vivanti, Giacomo, Outcome for Children Receiving the Early Start Denver Model Before and After 48 Months, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 46, 7, pp. 2441-2449, (2016); Elsabbagh, M., Global Prevalence of Autism and Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Autism Research, 5, 3, pp. 160-179, (2012)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","19290748","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135488513"

ECC is preventable and reversible if detected early. However, many children from low-income families encounter barriers to dental care. An at-home caries detection technology could potentially improve access to dental care regardless of patients’ economic status and address the overwhelming prevalence of ECC. Our team has developed a smartphone application (app), AICaries, that uses artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology to detect caries using children’s teeth photos. We used mixed methods to assess the acceptance, usability, and feasibility of the AICaries app among underserved parent-child dyads. We conducted moderated usability testing (Step 1) with ten parent-child dyads using ""Think-aloud"" methods to assess the flow and functionality of the app and analyze the data to refine the app and procedures. Next, we conducted unmoderated field testing (Step 2) with 32 parent-child dyads to test the app within their natural environment (home) over two weeks. We administered the System Usability Scale (SUS) and conducted semi-structured individual interviews with parents and conducted thematic analyses. AICaries app received a 78.4 SUS score from the participants, indicating an excellent acceptance. Notably, the majority (78.5%) of parent-taken photos of children’s teeth were satisfactory in quality for detection of caries using the AI app. Parents suggested using community health workers to provide training to parents needing assistance in taking high quality photos of their young child’s teeth. Perceived benefits from using the AICaries app include convenient at-home caries screening, informative on caries risk and education, and engaging family members. Data from this study support future clinical trial that evaluates the real-world impact of using this innovative smartphone app on early detection and prevention of ECC among low-income children. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This study is supported by the NIDCR Research grant R21DE030251.

Methods: Searches of PubMed identifying relevant reports up to March 2022. Results: AI is rare disorder that requires lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy and is associated with substantial morbidity and occasional mortality among adolescents and young adults. Aetiologies in this age group are more commonly congenital, with acquired causes, resulting from tumours in the hypothalamic-pituitary area and autoimmune adrenalitis among others, increasing with age. All patients with AI are at risk of AC, which have an estimated incidence of 6 to 8 ACs/100 patient years. Prevention of ACs includes use of educational interventions to achieve competency in dose escalation and parenteral glucocorticoid administration during times of physiological stress, such as an intercurrent infection. While the incidence of AI/AC in young children and adults has been documented, there are few studies focussed on the AC occurrence in adolescents and young adults with AI. This is despite the range of developmental, psychosocial, and structural changes that can interfere with chronic disease management during this important period of growth and development. Conclusion: In this review, we examine the current state of knowledge of AC epidemiology in emerging adults; examine the causes of ACs in this age group; and suggest areas for further investigation that are aimed at reducing the incidence and health impact of ACs in these patients. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adrenal insufficiency; Emergening adults; Incidence; Mortality; Precipitating factors; Prevention","adolescent; adrenal cortex insufficiency; adult; health impact assessment; human; incidence; morbidity; mortality; Review; risk factor; young adult; acute disease; Addison disease; adrenal insufficiency; child; preschool child; glucocorticoid; Acute Disease; Addison Disease; Adolescent; Adrenal Insufficiency; Child; Child, Preschool; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Incidence; Young Adult","","Glucocorticoids","","Bornstein, Stefan R., Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 101, 2, pp. 364-389, (2016); Rushworth, Rosemary Louise, Adrenal Crises in Children: Perspectives and Research Directions, Hormone Research in Paediatrics, 89, 5, pp. 341-351, (2018); Park, Julie, The diagnosis and treatment of adrenal insufficiency during childhood and adolescence, Archives of Disease in Childhood, 101, 9, pp. 860-865, (2016); Tallis, Philippa H., Adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal metastases – A systematic review and meta-analysis, Heliyon, 5, 5, (2019); Ventura, Mara, The spectrum of pediatric adrenal insufficiency: Insights from 34 years of experience, Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism, 32, 7, pp. 721-726, (2019); Broersen, Leonie H.A., Adrenal insufficiency in corticosteroids use: Systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 100, 6, pp. 2171-2180, (2015); Hayes, Annabelle G., Risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer treatment-related adrenal insufficiency, Expert Review of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 17, 1, pp. 21-33, (2022); Rushworth, Rosemary Louise, Adrenal crisis, New England Journal of Medicine, 381, 9, pp. 852-861, (2019); Sævik, Å.

In this study, we reveal how the agile intuition (AI) of top managers with respect to the external environment affects enterprise innovation behavior (IB) based on the cognition-behavior framework. Strategic learning (SL) is considered a moderator, and knowledge sharing (KS) is considered a mediator. The survey sample consists of 305 managers from 47 enterprises in China during the COVID-19 period. The empirical results show that top management agile intuition significantly promotes enterprise IB; knowledge sharing (KS) partially mediates the relationship between top manager AI and enterprise IB; and SL suppresses the promotion effect of top manager AI on enterprise IB to a certain extent, hindering blind innovation. In a surprising result, we find that strategic guidance by an external consultant does not significantly affect the enterprise IB in China. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; Article; behavior; bootstrapping; China; classification; cognition; confidence interval; confirmatory factor analysis; consultation; coronavirus disease 2019; employee; environmental impact; female; finance; health care survey; human; interview; intuition; knowledge management; learning; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; manager; manufacturing; middle aged; questionnaire; reliability; research; Strategic learning; technology; validity; young adult; knowledge; COVID-19; Humans; Intuition; Knowledge; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","Langang Feng received the project.

In the last five years, there has been an emerging body of empirical research applying the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in mental health. Objective: To review the clinical applicability of the AI/ML-based tools in suicide prevention. Methods: The compelling question of predicting suicidality has been the focus of this research. We performed a broad literature search and then identified 36 articles relevant to meet the objectives of this review. We review the available evidence and provide a brief overview of the advances in this field. Conclusion: In the last five years, there has been more evidence supporting the implementation of these algorithms in clinical practice. Its current clinical utility is limited to using electronic health records and could be highly effective in conjunction with existing tools for suicide prevention. Other potential sources of relevant data include smart devices and social network sites. There are some serious questions about data privacy and ethics which need more attention while developing these new modalities in suicide research. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescents and young adults; artificial intelligence; electronic health records; Machine learning; suicide prevention; suicide risk assessment","adolescent; adult; artificial intelligence; electronic health record; human; machine learning; medical ethics; mental health; natural language processing; predictive model; Review; social media; suicide; young adult","","","","Adamou, Marios C., Toward Automatic Risk Assessment to Support Suicide Prevention, Crisis, 40, 4, pp. 249-256, (2019); Adibuzzaman, Mohammad, Big data in healthcare - the promises, challenges and opportunities from a research perspective: A case study with a model database, AMIA Annual Symposium proceedings, 2017, pp. 384-392, (2017); Anderson, Heather D., Monitoring suicidal patients in primary care using electronic health records, Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 28, 1, pp. 65-71, (2015); Ati, Niken Asih Laras, What are the risk factors and protective factors of suicidal behavior in adolescents?

These disparities extend to the youngest community members in the form of early childhood caries (ECC). Although behavior and biology contribute to ECC, the conditions where people live, grow, and work, and the systems and political and economic forces that shape individual health outcomes, are thought to greatly impact ECC among AI/AN populations. To address ECC in AI/AN communities, we used a community based participatory approach that incorporated social determinants of health. We found that implementing culturally-tailored, culturally-centered, and AI/AN-created materials for ECC interventions is viewed favorably by community members and tribal leaders. Because of the complexity of ECC in AI/AN communities we adopted a bundled approach of best practices to reduce ECC including: (1) incorporating locally, contextually, and culturally relevant strategies to present recommended ECC prevention approaches; (2) employing AI/AN community members as educators; (3) utilizing motivational interviewing with expectant mothers; and (4) providing fluoride varnish. Our work underscores the importance of developing trusting partnerships with each other and with our communities, drawing upon the insights of community advisory board members, and eliciting formative assessment data from tribal members to gain a more holistic understanding of our participants' lived experience to design relevant intervention materials. Incorporating local knowledge and situating Western oral health prevention approaches within culturally aligned frameworks can enhance partnerships and create sustainable materials for community work. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian/Alaska Native; community based participatory research; early childhood caries; indigenous health; oral health","Alaska Native; American Indian; dental caries; human; participatory research; preschool child; Alaskan Natives; Child, Preschool; Community-Based Participatory Research; Dental Caries; Health Inequities; Humans; Indians, North American","","","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Grant/Award Number: U01 DE028508-01","Sukumaran, Anil P., Early childhood caries: Prevalence, risk factors, and prevention, Frontiers in Pediatrics, 5, (2017); Phipps, Kathy R., Prevalence and severity of dental caries among american indian and alaska native preschool children, Journal of Public Health Dentistry, 72, 3, pp. 208-215, (2012); Casamassimo, Paul S., Caries: Beyond the dmft: The human and economic cost of early childhood caries, Journal of the American Dental Association, 140, 6, pp. 650-657, (2009); Selwitz, Robert H., Dental caries, The Lancet, 369, 9555, pp. 51-59, (2007); Oral Health in America Advances and Challenges, (2021); da Fonseca, Márcio A., Social Determinants of Pediatric Oral Health, Dental Clinics of North America, 61, 3, pp. 519-532, (2017); Elwell, Kristan, A formative assessment of social determinants of health related to early childhood caries in two american indian communities, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 18, (2021); Dutta-Bergman, Mohan Jyoti, Communicating about culture and health: Theorizing culture-centered and cultural sensitivity approaches, Communication Theory, 17, 3, pp. 304-328, (2007); Wallerstein, Nina B., Culture-centeredness in community-based participatory research: Contributions to health education intervention research, Health Education Research, 34, 4, pp. 372-388, (2019); Heaton, Brenda, Using storytelling to address oral health knowledge in American Indian and Alaska Native communities, Preventing Chronic Disease, 15, 5, (2018)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","00224006","","JPHDA","35726469","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132307266"

Mobile-based therapy chatbots are increasingly being used to help young adults who suffer from depression. However, previous trials have short follow-up periods. Evidence of effectiveness in pragmatic conditions are still in lack. Objective: This study aimed to compare chatbot therapy to bibliotherapy, which is a widely accepted and proven-useful self-help psychological intervention. The main objective of this study is to add to the evidence of effectiveness for chatbot therapy as a convenient, affordable, interactive self-help intervention for depression. Methods: An unblinded randomized controlled trial with 83 university students was conducted. The participants were randomly assigned to either a chatbot test group (n = 41) to receive a newly developed chatbot-delivered intervention, or a bibliotherapy control group (n = 42) to receive a minimal level of bibliotherapy. A set of questionnaires was implemented as measurements of clinical variables at baseline and every 4 weeks for a period of 16 weeks, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR) were used to measure satisfaction and therapeutic alliance after the intervention. Participants' self-reported adherence and feedback on the therapy chatbot were also collected. Results: Participants were all university students (undergraduate students (n = 31), postgraduate students (n = 52)). They were between 19 and 28 years old (mean = 23.08, standard deviation (SD) = 1.76) and 55.42% (46/83) female. 24.07% (20/83) participants were lost to follow-up. No significant group difference was found at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, individuals in the chatbot test group showed a significant reduction in the PHQ-9 scores (F = 22.89; P < 0.01) and the GAD-7 scores (F = 5.37; P = 0.02). Follow-up analysis of completers suggested that the reduction of anxiety was significant only in the first 4 weeks. The WAI-SR scores in the chatbot group were higher compared to the bibliotherapy group (t = 7.29; P < 0.01). User feedback showed that process factors were more influential than the content factors. Conclusions: The chatbot-delivered self-help depression intervention was proven to be superior to the minimal level of bibliotherapy in terms of reduction on depression, anxiety, and therapeutic alliance achieved with participants. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI Artificial Intelligence; mHealth; Public health informatics","adult; Article; artificial intelligence; behavior assessment; bibliotherapy; chatbot; client satisfaction questionnaire 8; clinical assessment; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; emotion; female; follow up; generalized anxiety disorder; Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; human; language; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mobile application; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; patient safety; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; self help; university student; working alliance inventory short revised","","","The authors would like to thank all participants for attending the trial.","Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A., An overview of the features of chatbots in mental health: A scoping review, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 132, (2019); Abd-alrazaq, Alaa A., Effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health: Systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22, 7, (2020); Andersson, Gerhard, Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatments, Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, 12, pp. 157-179, (2016); Andrade, Laura Helena Silveira Guerra, Barriers to mental health treatment: Results from the WHO World Mental Health surveys, Psychological Medicine, 44, 6, pp. 1303-1317, (2014); Andrews, Bernice, The relation of depression and anxiety to life-stress and achievement in students, British Journal of Psychology, 95, 4, pp. 509-521, (2004); Barnett, Anthony I., Enacting ‘more-than-human’ care: Clients’ and counsellors’ views on the multiple affordances of chatbots in alcohol and other drug counselling, International Journal of Drug Policy, 94, (2021); Bendig, Eileen, Feasibility of a Software agent providing a brief Intervention for Self-help to Uplift psychological wellbeing (“SISU”).

No program evaluations of sexual risk avoidance programs have focused exclusively on AI youth and parents. This study assesses the impact of the Respecting the Circle of Life (RCL) Teenage Pregnancy Prevention program on parent-youth communication and parental monitoring through a randomized controlled trial with AI youth ages 11-19 and their trusted adults (parents/caregivers) (N = 518). RCL consists of 8-peer group and one parent-youth session. Trusted adult participants completed the Parental Monitoring Scale and the Parent Adolescent Communication Scale at baseline and 3 and 9 months post-intervention via self-report. Intervention impact was evaluated using linear regression models, which included an indicator for study group. At 3 months post, trusted adults in the intervention reported significantly higher levels of sexual health communication (P = 0.042) and spoke to their child more often about how to get condoms (P = 0.001), get birth control (P = 0.014) and protect themselves from human immunodeficiency virus (P = 0.005) compared with trusted adults in the control condition.

Technology-based health interventions that nurture resilience, coping skills, connectedness, and help-seeking skills may be an effective strategy for promoting health and wellbeing among AI/AN youth. The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board designed the BRAVE intervention for AI/AN youth. BRAVE is delivered via SMS text messaging and includes role model videos, mental wellness strategies, links to culturally relevant resources, and social support from family and friends. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore system data from the BRAVE intervention to determine patterns of user engagement and differences in psychosocial outcomes based on the number of clicks on BRAVE content. Methods: The BRAVE study included 1030 AI/AN teens and young adults nationwide (15 to 24 years old). The message series in the BRAVE and STEM study arms included 3 to 5 SMS text messages per week, featuring 1 role model video and 1 image per week. Messages were sent out via Mobile Commons (Upland Software Inc), a mobile messaging provider that supports text, picture, and video SMS. Results: Of the 509 participants in the original BRAVE analysis, 270 had sufficient data to analyze user engagement, with at least 1 trackable click on a study SMS text message. Of the 270, 184 (68.1%) were female, 50 (18.5%) were male, and 36 (13.3%) selected another gender category. The average participant was 20.6 years old, with a minimum and maximum age of 15 and 26 years. Most participants had relatively low engagement measured by the number of clicks (median 2; mean 3.4), although others clicked message content as many as 49 times. Users engaged most frequently with the YouTube-based content (viewing 1 of 7 role model videos), with 64.8% (175/270) of total clicks coming from the role model videos, and earlier episodes receiving the highest number of clicks. Most baseline psychosocial measures were not significantly associated with the number of links clicked. However, help-seeking behavior was highly significant (P<.001), with a rate ratio of 0.82 (0.73, 0.92), indicating that each 1-unit increase in help-seeking score at baseline was associated with an 18% decrease in the expected number of study content clicks. Conclusions: This is the first study to set initial standards for assessing user engagement in an mHealth intervention. Our work underscores the feasibility of exploring the impact of engagement on intended outcomes, allowing for more precise exploration of the dose-response relationship that may be realized through these low-touch interventions that offer promising potential for reaching high numbers of program participants. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescent; Alaska Native; American Indian; engagement; feasibility; help-seeking skills, text messaging; intervention; low-touch; mental health; mHealth, behavioral intervention; user engagement","","","","The BRAVE intervention was designed by the THRIVE and We R Native adolescent health teams at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB).

This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal effect of menopause on changes in adiposity indices (AI). Methods: A total number of 3876 non-menopausal women, aged > 20 years, who participated in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose study, were selected for the present study. They were followed from 1998 to 2018 at a 3-year interval and their adiposity indices were measured. Throughout the study, participants were categorized into two groups according to their menopausal status as group 1): women who reached menopause and group 2): women who did not reach menopause. The generalized estimation equation (GEE) models were used to compare the trend of changes in AIs between these two groups. Results: At the end of the study, a total number of 1479 (38.2%) participants reached menopause. The odds of general obesity decreased by 5% (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.90–0.99), and the odds of central obesity increased by 6% in group1 compared to group2 (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.12). Conclusions: Menopause alters the impact of aging on central fat distribution. Increasing awareness of the related risk in menopausal women and their healthcare professional may prevent adverse related outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthropometry; Menopause; Morbidity; Mortality; Non-communicable disease; Reproductive","adult; adverse outcome; aging; anthropometric parameters; anthropometry; Article; awareness; body fat distribution; controlled study; disease risk assessment; female; follow up; health care personnel; human; Iran; longitudinal study; major clinical study; menopause; morbidity; mortality; non communicable disease; obesity; reproductive health; risk reduction; statistical model; trend study; young adult; body composition; epidemiology; glucose blood level; metabolism; middle aged; organization and management; physiology; preventive health service; procedures; women's health; Adiposity; Adult; Aging; Blood Glucose; Body Composition; Body Fat Distribution; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Menopause; Middle Aged; Obesity; Preventive Health Services; Women's Health","","Blood Glucose","Funding text 1: We are appreciative to all the study participants for the substantial time and effort given to the present research.

Design: Observational, cross-sectional survey. Methods: Australian, 18- to 65-year-old women with self-identified PF symptoms during exercise (current, past or fear of) were included. This survey included validated questionnaires: Questionnaire for female Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis, Incontinence Severity Index, Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire and purpose-designed questions on the impact of PF symptoms on sport/exercise participation. Analysis utilised descriptive statistics. Chi-square tests for independence and t-tests were used to explore differences between groups. Results: Of 4556 women, 46% stopped exercise they had previously participated in due to their PF symptoms. Urinary incontinence had the largest impact; 41% with UI, followed by 37% with POP and 26% with AI stopped at least one form of exercise. Forty-two percent of women who experienced symptoms in high-impact sports stopped participation (versus low-impact: 21%). Sports commonly ceased included volleyball (63%), racquet-sports (57%) and basketball (54%). Exercise cessation was reported amongst younger (18–25 years: 35%) and nulliparous women (31%). Common exercise modifications included lowering the intensity (58%) or frequency (34%) of participation or changing to a low-impact form of sport/exercise (45%). Conclusions: Pelvic floor symptoms stop women of all ages and levels of participation from exercising. High-impact sports were most affected but low-impact sports were also ceased. Symptomatic women also modify exercise to less vigorous/frequent participation, which may place them at risk of physical inactivity, and chronic illness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anal incontinence; Exercise; Pelvic floor; Pelvic organ prolapse; Urinary incontinence; Women","adult; aged; Article; Australian; bladder disease; body mass; bothersomeness; chronic disease; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; disease severity; educational status; enteropathy; exercise; fear; feces incontinence; female; human; international physical activity questionnaire; major clinical study; medical history; menopause; menstruation; mixed incontinence; obesity; observational study; parity; pelvic floor disorder; pelvic organ prolapse; pelvis floor; physical activity; physical inactivity; quality of life; sport; stress incontinence; underweight; urinary urgency; urine incontinence; volleyball; women's health; adolescent; complication; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","This research was supported by funding from an Australian Physiotherapy Association Physiotherapy Research Foundation Seeding Grant and The Australian Bladder Foundation managed by the Continence Foundation of Australia .","undefined, (2020); Rodriguez-Ayllon, María, Role of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior in the Mental Health of Preschoolers, Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, Sports Medicine, 49, 9, pp. 1383-1410, (2019); undefined, (2020); undefined, (2014); undefined, (2018); undefined, (2020); MacLennan, Alastair Harvey, The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders and their relationship to gender, age, parity and mode of delivery, British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 107, 12, pp. 1460-1470, (2000); Incontinence, (2017); Bö, Kari, Is Physical Activity Good or Bad for the Female Pelvic Floor?

Leveraging We R Native, a multimedia health resource for Native teenagers and young adults, staff of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board designed the BRAVE intervention for Native youth. The program is delivered via SMS text messaging and includes role model videos, mental wellness strategies, links to culturally relevant resources, and social support from family and friends. Objective: We aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the BRAVE intervention among AI/AN teenagers and young adults (aged 15-24 years) to assess its impact on their physical, mental, and spiritual health; their resilience and self-esteem; and their coping and help-seeking skills. Methods: From October to December 2019, we recruited 2334 AI/AN teenagers and young adults nationwide via social media channels and SMS text messages and enrolled 1044 participants. AI/AN teenagers and young adults enrolled in the study received either BRAVE SMS text messages, designed to improve mental health, help-seeking skills, and cultural resilience, or 8 weeks of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) SMS text messages, designed to elevate and reaffirm Native voices in STEM and medicine and then received the BRAVE SMS text messages. The impacts of the BRAVE intervention were tested using linear mixed-effect models and linear regressions. Results: A total of 833 AI/AN teenagers and young adults were included in the analysis. Individuals in the BRAVE and STEM arms showed significant positive trends over the course of the study for all outcomes, except cultural identity and help-seeking behavior. Mean scores were significantly different for health (P<.001), resilience (P<.001), negative coping (P=.03), positive coping (P<.001), self-efficacy (P=.02), and self-esteem (P<.001). Changes in help-seeking self-efficacy were significant in those exhibiting risky behaviors at baseline to exit (P=.01). Those who reported positive coping scores at baseline also reported better health on average; however, no difference was found in risky drug and alcohol use (P<.001). The number of participants who used SMS text messages to help themselves increased from 69.1% (427/618) at 3 months to 76% (381/501; P<.001) at 8 months. Similarly, the number of participants who used SMS text messages to help friends or family members increased from 22.4% (138/616) at 3 months to 54.6% (272/498) at 8 months. Conclusions: This is the first national randomized controlled trial of a mobile health intervention among AI/AN teenagers and young adults to test the efficacy of a mental wellness intervention in relation to STEM career messages.

Program evaluations, largely based on estimations of projected savings and utilization reductions, have not accurately predicted actual claims and utilization changes, leading many to doubt the efficacy of medication management. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact on actual medical claims of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) platform that identifies members and provides decision support to clinicians in performing telephonic interventions similar to MTM and CMM with high-risk Medicaid members. METHODS: This retrospective observational study used mixed-effects regression models that flexibly account for general trends in cost, as measured by actual claims, to identify the amount of savings and associated impact. To study the economics, total cost of care (TCoC), defined as all medication costs plus all noncapitated medical costs, was evaluated. Utilization was evaluated through the number of emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, bed days, and readmissions. The study included 2,150 predominantly middleaged (aged 40-64 years) Medicaid members with an average of 10 medications for chronic conditions among an average of 25 total medications. The analysis considered cost and utilization data from August 2017 through April 2019. Interventions occurred between January 2018 and February 2019. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations were found between receiving interventions and decreased costs and utilization. The economic study found a 19.3% reduction in the TCoC (P < 0.001) that, applied to a preintervention monthly cost of $2,872, yielded a savings of $554 per member per month (PMPM). Medication costs showed a 17.4% reduction (P < 0.001), which, when applied to preintervention cost of $1,110, yielded a savings of $192 PMPM. The utilization study found a 15.1% reduction in ED visits (P = 0.002), a 9.4% reduction in hospital admissions (P = 0.008), and a 10.2% reduction in bed days (P = 0.01). Return on investment is 12.4:1 based on TCoC savings and program costs. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the CMM-Wrap program, which used an advanced AI platform integrated with health plan data, clinical pharmacists trained in disease management, telephonic patient engagement, and closed-loop provider coordination. The results correlate cost and utilization savings with the program. The TCoC savings of $554 PMPM translates to approximately $1.2M a month and more than $14M annually for the 2,150 members in the study. We believe Medicaid and Medicare payment of AI enhanced telephonic CMM services would substantially decrease government health care expenditures, whereas improving health program expansion to Medicaid members with similar risks could save the Health Plan $109M annually. For instance, we estimate that California's Medicaid (Medi-Cal) program could save more than $1B annually by applying the program's observed impact to a similar high-risk cohort (about 1.6%) of Medi-Cal members. Additionally, benefits will accrue to nonmanaged health plans based on the savings themselves. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; aged; artificial intelligence; clinical pharmacist; clinician; decision support system; disease management; emergency ward; female; health care cost; health care utilization; hospital admission; hospital readmission; human; major clinical study; male; medicaid; medication therapy management; observational study; patient education; program evaluation; regression analysis; retrospective study; Review; child; economics; infant; middle aged; pharmacy (shop); preschool child; United States; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Artificial Intelligence; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Medicaid; Medication Therapy Management; Middle Aged; Pharmaceutical Services; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult","","","There was no external funding for this study.

A patient with PUB management requires collaborative care involving the emergency department, gastroenterologist, radiologist, and surgeon, from initial assessment to hospital discharge. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods has remarkably improved people’s lives. In particular, AI systems have shown great potential in many areas of gastroenterology to increase human performance. Colonoscopy polyp detection or diagnosis by an AI system was recently introduced for commercial use to improve endoscopist performance. Although PUB is a longstanding health problem, these newly introduced AI technologies may soon impact endoscopists’ clinical practice by improving the quality of care for these patients. To update the current status of AI application in PUB, we reviewed recent relevant literature and provided future perspectives that are required to integrate such AI tools into real-world practice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Bleeding; Deep learning; Peptic ulcer","","","","Funding: This research was funded by Changhua Christian Hospital (109-CCH-CYCU-001, 109-CCH-IRP-008, and 110-CCH-IRP-20).","Frontline Gastroenterol, (2017); Penny, Hugo A., Changing trends in the UK management of upper GI bleeding: Is there evidence of reduced UK training experience?, Frontline Gastroenterology, 7, 1, pp. 67-72, (2016); Gralnek, Ian Mark, Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Guideline, Endoscopy, 47, 10, pp. a1-a46, (2015); Lau, Louis Ho Shing, Treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2020: New techniques and outcomes, Digestive Endoscopy, 33, 1, pp. 83-94, (2021); Shivaraju, Anupama, Temporal trends in gastrointestinal bleeding associated with percutaneous coronary intervention: Analysis of the 1998-2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, American Heart Journal, 162, 6, pp. 1062-e5, (2011); Barkun, Alan N.G., Management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Guideline recommendations from the international consensus group, Annals of Internal Medicine, 171, 11, pp. 805-822, (2019); Sung, Joseph Jao Yiu, Asia-Pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: An update 2018, Gut, 67, 10, pp. 1757-1768, (2018); Hajjar, Ahmad El, Artificial intelligence in gastrointestinal endoscopy: General overview, Chinese Medical Journal, 133, 3, pp. 326-334, (2020); Laine, Loren A., ACG Clinical Guideline: Upper Gastrointestinal and Ulcer Bleeding, American Journal of Gastroenterology, 116, 5, pp. 899-917, (2021); Shung, Dennis Legen, Early identification of patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding using natural language processing and decision rules, Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Australia), 36, 6, pp. 1590-1597, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","20770383","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112172231"

In times of scarcity, patient prioritization based on non-medical considerations might be necessary. Objective: The aim of this study was to pilot test a survey to elicit public opinions on the relative importance of non-medical considerations in priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU in times of crisis. Methods: A discrete-choice experiment was used to collect social preferences for priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The six attributes were patient age, profession, guardianship, risk-conscious behavior on a societal level, health-conscious behavior, and expected ICU length of stay. The data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model. Interactions between the age and profession of the respondents and the age and profession of the patient profiles were considered. Results: The mean (± standard deviation) age of respondents was 35.9 ± 14.5 years. In all, 70% of respondents indicated that medical and/or non-medical considerations should play a role in prioritizing patients for the ICU, whereas 15% agreed with a “first come, first served” strategy and the remaining 15% had no opinion. Respondents deemed risk-conscious behavior on a societal level to be the most important non-medical factor that should be used to prioritize patients in phase three of the framework, garnering an attribute importance (AI) of 31.2%, followed by patient age (AI 16.3%) and health-conscious behavior (AI 16.0%). ICU length of stay had the lowest impact on patient prioritization for ICU admittance (AI 10.9%). Younger and older respondents attached more importance to age than respondents in the middle age group and indicated a stronger preference to prioritize patients in their own age group (p = 0.042). Conclusion: The results of our study demonstrate the relative importance members of the public attach to responsible societal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next phase of the study, we will elicit the perspectives of a representative sample of the Dutch population. Changes to the task design and attribute operationalization could improve the external validity of the study findings, and optimization of the experimental design will improve the internal validity of the study. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; age; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; experimental design; female; health behavior; health care planning; health care survey; hospital admission; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; male; middle aged; Netherlands; pandemic; pilot study; priority journal; public opinion; aged; decision making; emergency health service; epidemiology; health care delivery; health care organization; procedures; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Choice Behavior; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Health Care Rationing; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Admission; Pilot Projects; Public Opinion; SARS-CoV-2; Triage; Young Adult","","","","Coronavirus Disease Covid 19 Technical Guidance Laboratory Testing for 2019 Ncov in Humans, (2020); undefined; undefined; undefined, (2020); undefined; Which Factors Should Be Included in Triage an Online Survey of the Attitudes of the Uk General Public to Pandemic Triage Dilemmas, (2020); Medrxiv, (2020); Johnson, F.

If infected, AI patients require prompt replacement tailoring. We assessed, in a cohort of AI patients: prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19; prevalence of AC and association with intercurrent COVID-19 or pandemic-related psychophysical stress; lockdown-induced emotional burden, and health-related QoL. Methods: In this monocentric (Ancona University Hospital, Italy), cross-sectional study covering February-April 2020, 121 (40 primary, 81 secondary) AI patients (59 males, 55 ± 17 years) completed telematically three questionnaires: the purpose-built “CORTI-COVID”, assessing medical history and concern for COVID-19-related global health, AI-specific personal health, occupational, economic, and social consequences; the AddiQoL-30; the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Results: COVID-19 occurred in one (0·8% prevalence) 48-year-old woman with primary AI, who promptly tailored her replacement. Dyspnea lasted three days, without requiring hospitalization. Secondary AI patients were not involved. No AC were experienced, but pandemic-related stress accounted for 6/14 glucocorticoid up-titrations. Mean CORTI-COVID was similar between groups, mainly depending on “personal health” in primary AI (ρ = 0.888, p < 0.0001) and “economy” in secondary AI (ρ = 0.854, p < 0.0001). Working restrictions increased occupational concern. CORTI-COVID correlated inversely with QoL. AddiQoL-30 and SF-36 correlated strongly. Comorbidities worsened patients’ QoL. Conclusion: If educational efforts are made in preventing acute events, AI patients seem not particularly susceptible to COVID-19. The novel “CORTI-COVID” questionnaire reliably assesses the pandemic-related emotional burden in AI. Even under unconventional stress, educated AI patients preserve a good QoL. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AddiQoL; Addison; Adrenal crisis; Hypopituitarism; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine COVID","glucocorticoid; AddiQoL-30; adolescent; adrenal insufficiency; adult; aged; Article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; drug dose titration; dyspnea; economics; emotion; female; global health; human; Italy; lockdown; major clinical study; male; medical history; mental stress; occupational health; open study; pandemic; physical stress; prevalence; quality of life; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; Short Form 36; social aspect; university hospital; work; complication; etiology; middle aged; psychology; quarantine; socioeconomics; telemedicine; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adrenal Insufficiency; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Quarantine; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Telemedicine; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the MIUR (Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca, grant number HRTZYA_005, 2017).

Thirty-eight percent of the preschool and kindergarten children who participated in this study were either overweight or obese. Potential reasons for this prevalence include the physical activity transition of AI people to sedentary lifestyles, in utero exposure to diabetes, and social determinants of health, especially poverty. In 2013, 29.8 percent of single-race AI/Alaska Native people were living in poverty. Childhood trauma and stress have also been linked to obesity. The experience of numerous negative life events in childhood increases the risk for being overweight by age 15. PURPOSE: Early-life home and preschool interventions with children between the ages of five and 14 have a greater impact on preventing childhood obesity, primarily with children who enter kindergarten already overweight. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and preliminary effects of the Strengthening Family Program (SFP) on the physical health (primarily weight) of AI young children. The goal of this study was to promote strong AI families and improve childhood health; however, the nutrition and exercise activities within the SFP were minimal and not adapted to the AI culture. Therefore, a nutrition and exercise program for AI children between the ages of three to five was developed. The primary objective for this study was then revised to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of the newly developed AI physical activity and nutrition adjunct program for preschool and kindergarten children. METHOD: Two 14-week sessions of the SFP were implemented with an AI activity and nutrition program that incorporated curricula from the Eagle Books and Health is Life in Balance. A mixed methods approach was used with a quasi-experimental wait-list control group design. Quantitative data gathered included child BMI pre- and post-intervention. A focus group was then conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the SFP and the AI activity and nutrition program. Results: Twenty-five children participated in either one of two intervention groups or one waitlist control group. The obesity rates of the preschool and kindergarten intervention groups stayed at 14 percent and at 38 percent pre- and post-intervention, respectively. The obesity rates for the waitlist control group, however, increased from 30 percent at pre-test to 50 percent at post-test. Focus group narratives resulted in two categories of strengths (positive child behaviors and meaning to child) and one weakness (adult disconnect). CONCLUSION: Caregiver participation was limited and challenging. Further community-based dialogue is needed to ensure sustainability.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between ACEs, anger expression, stress, and physical health in a sample of Asian Indian (AI) emerging adults (18–29 years) living in the United States. Method: Participants (N = 132; M<inf>age</inf> = 23.52; 13.6% first generation; 86.4% born in United States) completed an electronic questionnaire measuring variables of ACEs, anger expression, recent stress, health history, self-rated health, and recent physical illness symptoms. Chi-square, regression, and mediation analyses were conducted to examine associations among variables. Results: ACEs significantly predicted greater anger expression, perceived stress, number of chronic health conditions, and recent physical illness symptoms. Ninety-four percent of participants with ≥ 3 ACEs endorsed at least 1 previously diagnosed medical condition, and these participants exhibited remarkably high odds of diabetes and high blood pressure. Mediation analyses indicated anger expression significantly mediated ACEs’ impact on recent stress and physical illness symptoms. Conclusions: Findings evidence that ACE-related physical health consequences are, in fact, already detectable by emerging adulthood among AI Americans. The distinct ACEs patterns and pronounced ACE-related health consequences found in this population warrant further study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Clinical Impact Statement: Results shows that the physical health consequences of childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect, household dysfunction) are already detectable by early adulthood among Asian Indian (AI) Americans. Findings suggest that these health consequences may be particularly pronounced among AI emerging adults.

Objective: To assess the current patterns of fluid consumption in children and adolescents in Spain, including drinking occasions and locations (e.g., at home or at school), and to compare TFI with adequate intake (AI) of water from fluids as recommended by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA). Methodology: A Spanish cross-sectional study was performed assessing TFI from all sources of fluid consumption according to drinking occasions during the day and location, using a validated liquid intake 7-day record (Liq.in7). Data collection occurred between April and May, 2018. A sample of 146 (63% boys) children (4-9 years old) and adolescents (10-17 years old) was included. Parents reported such information when children were under 16 years. Results: A high proportion of children and adolescents did not meet EFSA-derived reference values for fluid intake (73% and 72%, respectively). Forty percent of children and about 50% of adolescents consumed at least one serving of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) per day, while about 20% consumed only one or less servings of water per day. Consumption during the main meals was most important for both children and adolescents (representing 50% and 54% of TFI, respectively), and was mainly driven by water (62%). Consumption at home in children (70% of TFI) was made of water (47%). In the same way, at school, water contributed to half intake. However, adolescent girls at school drink more SSBs (41%) than water (34%), the former being the most consumed fluid. At other locations, adolescent boys also drink more SSBs (51%) than either water (29%) or milk and derivatives (10%). Conclusion: The drinking habits of Spanish young populations are far removed from current recommendations because of a low fluid intake, specifically water, and a high proportion of SSB consumption in children and adolescents. Interventions to ensure that EFSA TFI recommendations are met are of special importance for children and adolescents, with-according to our results-a special focus on male adolescents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Children and adolescents; European Food Safety Authority; Total fluid intake","adolescent; beverage; child; cross-sectional study; drinking; female; human; male; preschool child; Spain; Adolescent; Beverages; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drinking; Female; Humans; Male","","","Acknowledgements: the first author was funded by the Red de Salud Materno-Infantil y del Desarrollo (SAMID) (RETICS, funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Ref: RD16/0022) with the contribution of the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of Turkish dental students towards AI and to provide information about their opinions to use of AI in dentistry. Methods: A 22-question survey was distributed through Google Forms to all dental students at 9 Turkish dental schools in March 2019. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the dental students’ knowledge and attitudes toward AI and possible applications in dentistry. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results: A total of 1103 students (650 female, 453 male; mean age was 21.36 ± 1.93 years) responded to the questionnaire for a 21.69% response rate. Of these, about 48.40% had basic knowledge about AI technologies and 10.6% stated that they had no information sources about AI. 85.70% agreed that dentistry would be revolutionized by AI but 28.60% did not agree that AI could replace themselves in the near future. In addition, 74.60% and 79.80% of agreed on topics about AI to be included in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education, respectively. Conclusions: Although participants have insufficient knowledge of AI, they are willing to improve their knowledge in this field. Participants shared an optimistic views and thought that AI will have a positive impact on dental future practice.

With more than 1 million social media views per year, recognized as a trusted health resource, it was possible to recruit and enroll AI/AN teens and young adults in the BRAVE study. Living in urban and rural communities across the U.S., AI/ANs are generally considered a hard-to-reach population. Bridging theses vast territories, mHealth interventions make it uniquely possible to recruit and retain a national sample of AI/AN teens and young adults in behavioral health studies. NPAIHB utilized multiple recruitment methods to build community interest in BRAVE, including e-Newsletters, listservs, conferences, print postcards, tribal epidemiology centers, websites, social media native influencers, and Native student centers at schools and universities. During the recruitment phase, Facebook Ads with a positive tone received more impressions than Ads that simply described this study.

A previous paper described the process of identifying a pool of items which might be suitable for measuring HRQoL of children aged 0–3 years. The current paper describes how the items were pruned and the final draft of the measure, Toddler and Infant (TANDI) Health Related Quality of Life, was tested for validity and reliability. Methods: A sample of 187 caregivers of children 1–36 months of age were recruited which included children who were either acutely ill (AI), chronically ill (CI) or from the general school going population (GP). The TANDI, an experimental version of the EQ-5D-Y proxy, included six dimensions with three levels of report and general health measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 100. The content validity had been established during the development of the instrument. The TANDI, Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), Faces, Leg, Activity, Cry, Consolabilty (FLACC) or Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) and a self-designed dietary information questionnaire were administered at baseline. The TANDI was administered 1 week later in GP children to establish test-retest reliability. The distribution of dimension scores, Cronbach’s alpha, rotated varimax factor analysis, Spearman’s Rho Correlation, the intraclass correlation coefficient, Pearson’s correlation, analysis of variance and regression analysis were used to explore the reliability, and validity of the TANDI. Results: Concurrent validity of the different dimensions was tested between the TANDI and other instruments. The Spearman’s Rho coefficients were significant and moderate to strong for dimensions of activity and participation and significant and weak for items of body functions. Known groups were compared and children with acute illness had the lowest ranked VAS (median 60, range 0–100), indicating worse HRQoL. The six dimensions of the TANDI were tested for internal consistency and reliability and the Cronbach’s α as 0.83. Test-retest results showed no variance for dimension scores of movement and play, and high agreement for pain (83%), relationships (87%), communication (83%) and eating (74%). The scores were highly correlated for the VAS (ICC = 0.76; p < 0.001). Conclusion: The TANDI was found to be valid and reliable for use with children aged 1–36 months in South Africa. It is recommended that the TANDI be included in future research to further investigate HRQoL and the impact of interventions in this vulnerable age group. It is further recommended that future testing be done to assess the feasibility, clinical utility, and cross-cultural validity of the measure and to include international input in further development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Child; EQ-5D-Y; Health; Health-related quality of life; HRQoL; Infant; Outcome measure; Pre-schooler; Proxy; Toddler","","","","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the EuroQol foundation for permission to develop an experimental version based on the EQ-5D-Y proxy version.; Funding text 2: The author would like to acknowledge and thank the Harry Crossley Foundation for their support from the research fellowship.

Typically light smokers, cessation interventions in AIs are generally less effective. To develop more effective cessation programs for AIs, clinicians, researchers, and public health workers need a better understanding of the genetic factors involved in their smoking behavior. Our aim was to assess whether SNPs associated with smoking behavior in NHWs are also associated with smoking in AIs. Methods: We collected questionnaire data on smoking behaviors and analyzed blood and saliva samples from two Tribal populations with dramatically different cultures and smoking prevalence, one in the Northern Plains (n = 323) and the other in the Southwest (n = 176). A total of 384 SNPs were genotyped using an Illumina custom GoldenGate platform. Samples were also assessed for cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine as markers of nicotine intake and nicotine metabolite ratio. Results: Among 499 participants, we identified, in the Northern Plains sample only, a variant of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-2 (GABRA2) (rs2119767) on chromosome 4p that was associated with many of the intake biomarkers of smoking we examined, suggesting a role for this gene in modifying smoking behavior in this population. We also identified three SNPs, in the Southwest sample only, as significant correlates of only cigarettes per day: rs4274224, rs4245147 (both dopamine receptor D2 gene), and rs1386493 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2 gene). Conclusions: The contribution of many genes known to underlie smoking behaviors in NHWs may differ in AIs. Impact: Once validated, these variants could be useful in developing more effective cessation strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; aged; epidemiology; female; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; smoking; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; American Indians or Alaska Natives; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: J.A.

Therefore, we conducted the present study to clarify it. Methods: In total, 85,254 ED patients with chest pain in three hospitals between 2009 and 2018 were identified. We randomized the patients into a 70%/30% split for ML model training and testing. We used 14 clinical variables from their electronic health records to construct a random forest model with the synthetic minority oversampling technique preprocessing algorithm to predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) < 1 month and all-cause mortality < 1 month. Comparisons of the predictive accuracies among random forest, logistic regression, support-vector clustering (SVC), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models were also performed. Results: Predicting MACE using the random forest model produced areas under the curves (AUC) of 0.915 for AMI < 1 month and 0.999 for all-cause mortality < 1 month. The random forest model had better predictive accuracy than logistic regression, SVC, and KNN. We further integrated the AI prediction model with the HIS to assist physicians with decision-making in real time. Validation of the AI prediction model by new patients showed AUCs of 0.907 for AMI < 1 month and 0.888 for all-cause mortality < 1 month. Conclusions: An AI real-time prediction model is a promising method for assisting physicians in predicting MACE in ED patients with chest pain. Further studies to evaluate the impact on clinical practice are warranted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Chest pain; Emergency department; Machine learning; Major adverse cardiac events","adult; aged; algorithm; artificial intelligence; clinical trial; female; heart infarction; hospital emergency service; human; male; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; statistical model; Taiwan; thorax pain; young adult; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Chest Pain; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Mortality; Myocardial Infarction; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by Chi Mei Medical Center, [Grant number CMFHR CMFHR10991].","Bayón Fernández, Julián, Chest pain units.

Data were collected over 12-month follow-up with 267 AI youth aged 13–19. We used mixed effects regression models to examine: (1) whether trajectory patterns of HIV/AIDS knowledge, condom beliefs, condom use self-efficacy, condom use intention and partner negotiation skills differed by baseline levels categorized into low, medium, and high scorers, and (2) the characteristics of youth who made no improvement over the post-intervention period. Results indicate the RCL intervention had greater longitudinal impact among subgroups with low and medium initial scores. High initial scores in knowledge, beliefs, efficacy, intention and skills predicted unresponsiveness to the RCL intervention. Youth differences in age, gender and school truancy (skipping/suspension) did not predict responsiveness to RCL. Results have important prevention science implications: (1) AI youth at greater risk (i.e., those with low initial levels of knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, intention and skills) are likely to respond to RCL and should be the target of replication and dissemination efforts. (2) Responsiveness analyses can guide adaptation of RCL and other sexual and reproductive health programs for AI youth to improve efficacy among unresponsive subgroups (i.e., high initial scorers). (3) RCL is equally likely to impact AI youth across different ages, genders and school status, thus validating population-wide implementation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; American Indian/Alaska Native; HIV/AIDS; Responsiveness; Sexual and reproductive health","adolescent; Alaska Native; American Indian; article; condom use; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; follow up; gender; health program; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; juvenile; male; nonhuman; reproductive health; risk reduction; self concept; skill; suspension; truancy; adolescent behavior; adult; attitude to health; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; psychology; sexual behavior; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Risk Reduction Behavior; Sexual Behavior; Time Factors; Young Adult","","","This study was funded by the Native American Research Centers for Health (#U26IHS300286/02).","Aber, J.

However, most scientists, engineers, and clinicians are not prepared to contribute to the AI revolution in healthcare. In this paper, we describe our experiences teaching a new undergraduate course for American students that aims to prepare the next generation for cross-cultural designthinking, which we believe is crucial for AI to achieve its full potential in breast cancer care. Materials and methods: The key course activities are planning, conducting, and interpreting interviews of healthcare professionals from both Portugal and the United States. Since the course is offered as a short-term faculty-led study abroad program in Portugal, students are able to explore the impact of culture on healthcare delivery and the design of healthcare technologies. Results: The learning assessments demonstrated student growth in several areas pertinent for future development of AI for breast cancer care. With respect to understanding breast cancer care, prior to taking this course, most students had underestimated the impact of cancer and its treatment on women's quality of life and most were unaware of the importance of multidisciplinary care teams. Regarding AI in medicine, students became more mindful of data privacy issues and the need to consider the effect of AI on healthcare professionals. Conclusion: This course illustrates the potential benefits for AI in medicine of introducing future scientists, engineers, and clinicians to cross cultural design-thinking early in their educational experiences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Breast cancer; Cross-cultural; Designthinking; Education; Undergraduate","Article; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; cross cultural design thinking; education; health care; human; priority journal; undergraduate student; biomedical engineering; breast tumor; cultural factor; curriculum; female; intersectoral collaboration; male; patient care; Portugal; psychology; student; United States; young adult; Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Engineering; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Intersectoral Collaboration; Male; Patient Care Team; Students; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: We thank the International Engineering Education office at The University of Texas at Austin for the opportunity to teach International Perspectives on Biomedical Engineering Design in the Maymester format.

This paper seeks to identify critical program components of the RCL intervention for replication of impacts on condom use intention (CUI) when scaling to additional communities. RCL was tested among AI adolescents through a cluster randomized controlled trial (N = 267) embedded in an 8-day basketball camp. Data were collected at baseline, immediately post-camp, at 6 and 12 months post-camp. Previously established predictors of CUI that were statistically significantly impacted by RCL at the post-camp time point were tested as mediators of RCL impact on CUI. Condom use self-efficacy and response efficacy fully mediated the effect of RCL on CUI. The indirect path through condom use self-efficacy had the greatest effect on CUI, explaining 79% of the direct effect. When stratified by gender, there was only evidence of mediation among girls. Results indicate condom use self-efficacy and response efficacy are critical components of the RCL intervention for AI girls, and sexual/reproductive health programs should include practical skills training to improve these constructs to maximize intervention impact on CUI. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","adolescent; American Indian; condom use intention; condom use self-efficacy; response efficacy; sexual health","adolescent; American Indian; article; basketball; child; condom use; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; gender; health program; human; major clinical study; male; randomized controlled trial; reproductive health; self concept; sexual health; skill; attitude to health; behavior; condom; ethnology; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; program evaluation; psychology; risk reduction; sexual behavior; young adult; Adolescent; Condoms; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Indians, North American; Intention; Program Evaluation; Reproductive Health; Risk Reduction Behavior; Self Efficacy; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Health; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by Native American Research Centers for Health: [Grant Number U26IHS300286/03].

The work is founded on a tribally-mandated, community-based suicide surveillance system with case management by local community mental health specialists (CMHSs) who strive to connect at-risk youth to treatment and brief, adjunctive interventions piloted in past research. Methods: Our primary aim is to evaluate which brief interventions, alone or in combination, have the greater effect on suicide ideation (primary outcome) and resilience (secondary outcome) among AI youth ages 10-24 ascertained for suicide-related behaviors by the tribal surveillance system. We are using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial with stratified assignment based on age and suicidal-behavior type, and randomizing N = 304 youth. Brief interventions are delivered by AI CMHSs, or by Elders with CMHS support, and include: 1) New Hope, an evidence-based intervention to reduce immediate suicide risk through safety planning, emotion regulation skills, and facilitated care connections; and 2) Elders' Resilience, a culturally-grounded intervention to promote resilience through connectedness, self-esteem and cultural identity/values. The control condition is Optimized Case Management, which all study participants receive. We hypothesize that youth who receive: a) New Hope vs. Optimized Case Management will have significant reductions in suicide ideation; b) Elders' Resilience vs. Optimized Case Management will have significant gains in resilience; c) New Hope followed by Elders' Resilience will have the largest improvements on suicide ideation and resilience; and d) Optimized Case Management will have the weakest effects of all groups. Our secondary aim will examine mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness and sequencing. Discussion: Due to heterogeneity of suicide risk/protective factors among AI youth, not all youth require the same types of interventions. Generating evidence for what works, when it works, and for whom is paramount to AI youth suicide prevention efforts, where rates are currently high and resources are limited. Employing Native paraprofessionals is a means of task-shifting psychoeducation, culturally competent patient support and continuity of care.

Transformations are needed in academia to help understand Indigenous ‘ways of knowing.’ Lifting the voices of AI/ANs in telling their stories could improve the education of students, faculty and the lay public. We collaborated to develop, implement and evaluate a Native American Health Seminar Series taught by AI/AN leaders on addressing health disparities among AI/AN people. A quasi-experimental mixed methods design included a 15-item survey to assess the impact of the Seminar Series on knowledge of AI/AN health issues and its influence, among students, on health career choices. During the 2018 academic year, three seminars were held and 243 participants attended. In total, 182 surveys (74.9%) were completed by faculty members, students and members of the lay public. Students (all categories combined) represented the highest participant group (48.4%), followed by the lay public at 30% and faculty at 21.6%. The highest scores on knowledge of Native health issues prior to seminar attendance were reported by those representing the lay public with a mean of 3.96 compared to 3.67 for faculty and 3.43 among students (p = 0.01), which was highly represented by Indigenous people. Increases in knowledge occurred in all participant groups. Among students, 65.6% initially indicated that they were not planning on pursuing a career in Native health. Among these, 56.9% indicated they were somewhat to extremely likely to pursue a career in Native health as a result of having attended the seminar. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Career choice; Health disparities; Indigenous health and healing; Indigenous health education; Tribal health workforce","adult; Alaska Native; American Indian; article; awareness; controlled study; decision making; female; health disparity; health education; health workforce; human; human experiment; leadership; major clinical study; male; student; adolescent; continuing education; cultural competence; education; health care personnel; middle aged; Oregon; transcultural care; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alaska Natives; Career Choice; Cultural Competency; Culturally Competent Care; Education, Continuing; Female; Health Personnel; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Students; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the Northwest Native American Center of Excellence (NNACOE), funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau of Health Workforce under Grant No. D34HP31026 for NNACOE.","Kunitz, Stephen J., Changing patterns of mortality among American Indians, American Journal of Public Health, 98, 3, pp. 404-411, (2008); Northwest American Indian and Alaska Native Mortality, (2012); A Profile of American Indians and Alaska Natives and their Health Coverage, (2009); American Indian Alaska Native Community Health Profileoregon Washington Idaho, (2014); American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates, (2016); Indian Health Service Performance Results, (2016); High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey Data, (1991); Ihs Vacancy Rates, (2015); Clinical Workforce Survey A National Survey of Hospital Executives Examining Clinical Workforce Issues in the Era of Health Reform, (2013); Staffing the Safety Net Building the Primary Care Workforce at Americas Health Centers, (2016)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","00945145; 15733610","","JCMHB","31104200","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066107495"

Understanding the limitations of the current assessment tools in the identification of AI is paramount for identifying the prevalence of AI and improving the care and management for women of childbearing age. The aim of this research was to explore and develop an understanding of women's experiences in disclosing AI when completing a new bowel-screening questionnaire when compared to two established AI tools. Methods: A phenomenological qualitative research study was undertaken in a maternity setting in a large tertiary hospital. Parous women in the first trimester of a subsequent pregnancy were recruited to complete a specifically designed screening tool (BSQ), St Marks Faecal incontinence score (Vaizey) and Cleveland (Wexner) score. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were utilised to identify experiences in disclosing AI. Results: Women (n = 16, 22-42 years) with a history of anal incontinence either following the first birth (n = 12) or the second (n = 4) provided differing responses between the three assessment tools. All women answered the BSQ while the Vaizey and Wexner scores were more difficult to complete due to clinical language and participants level of comprehension. Women identified three major themes that were barriers for disclosing incontinence, which included social expectations, trusted space and confusion. Conclusion: There are barriers for disclosing AI in the pregnant and post-natal population, which can be improved with the use of an easy assessment tool. The BSQ may facilitate discussion on AI between the patient and health professional leading to earlier identification and improvement in short and long-term health outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anal; Incontinence; Reproductive; Screening; Tools; Women","adult; anxiety; Article; bowel screening tool; Cleveland Wexner score; clinical article; confusion; controlled study; coping behavior; daily life activity; digestive system disease assessment; expectation; feces incontinence; female; first trimester pregnancy; hopelessness; human; interpersonal communication; medical history; personal experience; qualitative research; screening test; St Marks Faecal incontinence score; trust; pregnancy; prenatal diagnosis; prevalence; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; self disclosure; young adult; Adult; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Prenatal Diagnosis; Prevalence; Qualitative Research; Risk Factors; Self Disclosure; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","DeLancey, John O., Graphic integration of causal factors of pelvic floor disorders: an integrated life span model, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 199, 6, pp. 610-610.e5, (2008); Dudding, Thomas C., Obstetric anal sphincter injury: Incidence, risk factors, and management, Annals of Surgery, 247, 2, pp. 224-237, (2008); Bortolini, Maria Augusta Tezelli, Vaginal delivery and pelvic floor dysfunction: Current evidence and implications for future research, International Urogynecology Journal, 21, 8, pp. 1025-1030, (2010); Thornton, Michelle J., Obstetric-induced incontinence: A black hole of preventable morbidity, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 46, 6, pp. 468-473, (2006); Jangö, Hanna, Recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injury and the risk of long-term anal incontinence, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 216, 6, pp. 610-610.e8, (2017); BJOG, (2014); Bugg, George John, Routine symptom screening for postnatal urinary and anal incontinence in new mothers from a district, International Urogynecology Journal, 16, 5, pp. 405-408, (2005); Women Birth, (2016); Rušavý, Zdeněk, Anal incontinence severity assessment tools used worldwide, International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 126, 2, pp. 146-150, (2014); Johannessen, Hege Hølmo, Prevalence and predictors of anal incontinence during pregnancy and 1 year after delivery: A prospective cohort study, BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 121, 3, pp. 269-280, (2014)","","BioMed Central info@biomedcentral.com","","","","","","14726874","","BWHMA","31752828","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075441835"

Effective prevention strategies are needed, but the evidence base remains thin for this population. Research makes clear that prevention strategies need to be culturally coherent; programs with an evidence base in one population cannot be assumed to be effective in another. However, guidance on effective adaptation is lacking. This paper reports on cultural adaptation of an evidence-based program utilizing the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework embedded within a community-engaged process to evaluate intervention components. The Strengthening Families Program for Parents and Youth 10-14 was adapted to become the Thiwáhe Gluwáš’akapi Program for American Indian youth and families. Three program components were evaluated for their effectiveness with regard to outcomes (youth substance use, theoretical mediators of program effects on substance use, and program attendance) in a sample of 98 families (122 youth and 137 adults). Consistent with the MOST framework, the value of components was also evaluated with regard to efficiency, economy, and scalability. Expanding on the MOST framework for cultural adaptation, we also considered the results of the MOST findings regarding the acceptability of each component from the perspectives of community members and participants. The promise of a strategic component-based approach to adapting evidence-based interventions is discussed, including the benefits of engaging community to ensure relevance and considering both cultural and scientific rationale for each component to enhance impact. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptation; Adolescent substance use; American Indian; Prevention","adult; American Indian; article; comparative effectiveness; economic aspect; evidence based practice center; female; human; human experiment; juvenile; major clinical study; male; mediator; outcome assessment; substance use; theoretical study; adolescent; aged; child; cultural competence; drug dependence; health promotion; middle aged; program evaluation; questionnaire; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cultural Competency; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","This study received financial support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, R01DA035111, Whitesell, PI.","Monitoring the Future Questionnaire Responses from the Nation S High School Seniors, (1999); Barrera, Manuel, Cultural adaptations of behavioral health interventions: a progress report, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 81, 2, pp. 196-205, (2013); Castro, Felipe González, Advances in EBI Development for Diverse Populations: Towards a Science of Intervention Adaptation, Prevention Science, 18, 6, pp. 623-629, (2017); Suicide Facts at A Glance, (2012); Optimization of Behavioral Biobehavioral and Biomedical Interventions the Multiphase Optimization Strategy Most, (2018); de Ravello, Lori, Substance use and sexual risk behaviors among American Indian and Alaska native high school students, Journal of School Health, 84, 1, pp. 25-32, (2014); Grant, Bridget F., Epidemiology of DSM-5 drug use disorder results from the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions-III, JAMA Psychiatry, 73, 1, pp. 39-47, (2016); Hughes, Diane Leslie, Parents' ethnic-racial socialization practices: A review of research and directions for future study, Developmental Psychology, 42, 5, pp. 747-770, (2006); Ivanich, Jerreed D., Pathways of Adaptation: Two Case Studies with One Evidence-Based Substance Use Prevention Program Tailored for Indigenous Youth, Prevention Science, 21, pp. 43-53, (2020); Kaufman, Carol E., Circle of life: Rationale, design, and baseline results of an HIV prevention intervention among young American Indian adolescents of the Northern Plains, Prevention Science, 11, 1, pp. 101-112, (2010)","","Springer New York LLC barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","13894986; 15736695","","","31376058","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071785852"

Diabetes is one of the diseases with the greatest socio-sanitary impact, both due to the great importance it has, and also due to the large number of chronic complications that the patient has and in addition to its high mortality rate. Diabetes is a silent disease and every day in our country there are more people who suffer from it, it is unfortunate that many young people are developing this disease they do not know they have it. Using innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) applied to sensitive areas such as health is increasing every day.

Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices. Methods: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care-related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R2=0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; P<.001), perceived usefulness (beta=.336; P=.03), and resistance bias (beta=-.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=-.095; P=.049) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use. Conclusions: The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should therefore avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adoption; Artificial intelligence; Intention; Moderation; Structural equation model; Subjective norms; Technology acceptance model; Trust","adolescent; adult; artificial intelligence; China; cross-sectional study; female; health care delivery; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; procedures; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychology; Young Adult","","","","Reddy, Sandeep, Artificial intelligence-enabled healthcare delivery, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 112, 1, pp. 22-28, (2019); He, Jianxing, The practical implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in medicine, Nature Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 30-36, (2019); Li, Xi, The primary health-care system in China, The Lancet, 390, 10112, pp. 2584-2594, (2017); Yang, Xiaohui, From the prevention and treatment of blindness to the universal eye health, Ophthalmology in China, 26, 1, pp. 1-3, (2017); Medicine and Society, (2017); Zhang, Guisen, Prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in Baotou:A cross-sectional study, Medicine (United States), 95, 37, (2016); Wang, Guiqin, Prevalence and risk factors for eye diseases, blindness, and low vision in Lhasa, Tibet, International Journal of Ophthalmology, 6, 2, pp. 237-241, (2013); Burlina, Philippe M., Automated grading of age-related macular degeneration from color fundus images using deep convolutional neural networks, JAMA Ophthalmology, 135, 11, pp. 1170-1176, (2017); Topol, Eric J., High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence, Nature Medicine, 25, 1, pp. 44-56, (2019); Kermany, Daniel S., Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning, Cell, 172, 5, pp. 1122-1131.e9, (2018)","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","14388871","","","31625950","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073603025"

This article describes the current prevalence of meditation and identifies significant individual and health system-related factors associated with its use. Design: Cross-sectional descriptive analysis of the 2017 National Health Interview Survey analyzed in 2019. Setting/Location: United States. Subjects: The adult, civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Outcome measures: Self-reported use of any type of meditation in past year (mantra, mindfulness, spiritual, guided imagery, and progressive relaxation) or as part of yoga or t'ai chi practice. Control variables included demographic characteristics, health status, risk behaviors, and health system-related factors (self-reported barriers and facilitators to health care access) hypothesized to be associated with greater meditation use. Results: Over 46 million people (19% of the adult, civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population) currently practice some type of meditation. Three main factors predict meditation use: The presence of a health problem (chronic disease, pain, anxiety/depression, and sleeping problems), cost or access barriers to conventional medical care, and individual characteristics (younger age, female sex, and sexual minority status). Conclusions: Meditation is one of the most common forms of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States today. While its health benefits are still emerging, public health practitioners and clinicians should be aware of the increasing use of these therapies to treat common health problems, their relatively low prevalence among some groups that might benefit from them (such as older people, those with less healthy lifestyles, and men), and their higher use among those who face barriers to obtaining conventional care. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","complementary and alternative medicine; health care access; meditation","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Buddhist; chronic disease; chronic pain; cross-sectional study; depression; descriptive research; female; guided imagery; health behavior; health care; health care access; health care cost; health status; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; mantra meditation; medical care; medically uninsured; meditation; mindfulness meditation; pain; prevalence; priority journal; progressive relaxation; self report; sexual and gender minority; sleep disorder; spiritual healing; Tai Chi; transcendental meditation; United States; yoga; aged; health care delivery; middle aged; patient attitude; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Behavior; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Young Adult","","","","Black, Lindsey I., Use of Yoga, Meditation, and Chiropractors Among U.S. Children Aged 4-17 Years, National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, 324, pp. 1-8, (2018); Chiesa, Alberto, Mindfulness-based stress reduction for stress management in healthy people: A review and meta-analysis, Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15, 5, pp. 593-600, (2009); Goyal, Madhav, Meditation programs for psychological stress and well-being: A systematic review and meta-analysis, JAMA Internal Medicine, 174, 3, pp. 357-368, (2014); Sharma, Manoj, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as a Stress Management Intervention for Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review, Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, 19, 4, pp. 271-286, (2014); Pascoe, Michaela C., Yoga, mindfulness-based stress reduction and stress-related physiological measures: A meta-analysis, Psychoneuroendocrinology, 86, pp. 152-168, (2017); Pascoe, Michaela C., Mindfulness mediates the physiological markers of stress: Systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Psychiatric Research, 95, pp. 156-178, (2017); Chen, Kevin W., Meditative therapies for reducing anxiety: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, Depression and Anxiety, 29, 7, pp. 545-562, (2012); Lakhan, Shaheen Emmanuel, Mindfulness-Based Therapies in the Treatment of Somatization Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, PLOS ONE, 8, 8, (2013); Piet, Jacob, The effect of mindfulness-based therapy on symptoms of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients and survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 80, 6, pp. 1007-1020, (2012); Hilton, Lara G., Mindfulness Meditation for Chronic Pain: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis, Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 51, 2, pp. 199-213, (2017)","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc. info@liebertpub.com","","","","","","15577708; 10755535","","JACPF","31381366","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072266102"

However, currently available AI systems do not interact with a patient, e.g., for anamnesis, and thus are only used by the physicians for predictions in diagnosis or prognosis. However, these systems are widely used, e.g., in diabetes or cancer prediction. In the current study, we developed an AI that is able to interact with a patient (virtual doctor) by using a speech recognition and speech synthesis system and thus can autonomously interact with the patient, which is particularly important for, e.g., rural areas, where the availability of primary medical care is strongly limited by low population densities. As a proof-of-concept, the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks. Moreover, the system provides an easy-to-interpret probability estimation for T2DM for a given patient. Besides the development of the AI, we further analyzed the acceptance of young people for AI in healthcare to estimate the impact of such a system in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Diabetes; Diagnostics; E-health; Machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; E-learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Medical problems; Plasma diagnostics; Population statistics; Speech recognition; Speech synthesis; Cancer prediction; Clinical decision support systems; Non-invasive prediction; Non-invasive sensors; Population densities; Probability estimation; Speech synthesis system; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Decision support systems; hemoglobin A1c; agronomy; Article; awareness; cleaning; clinical decision support system; deep learning; diabetes mellitus; engineering; female; forestry; health care; health care need; human; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutritional science; physician; population density; prediction; primary medical care; priority journal; proof of concept; speech discrimination; artificial intelligence; automatic speech recognition; body height; body mass; body weight; computer interface; middle aged; probability; questionnaire; waist circumference; Artificial Intelligence; Body Height; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Deep Learning; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Probability; Speech Recognition Software; Surveys and Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface; Waist Circumference","","hemoglobin A1c, 62572-11-6","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part through funding by the Deichmann Foundation (DH and AC) and by the Wilhelm-Laupitz-Foundation to AC.; Funding text 2: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional self-administered paper-and-pencil survey using a standardized questionnaire.

SUMMARY ANSWER: We created a deep learning model named IVY, which was an objective and fully automated system that predicts the probability of FH pregnancy directly from raw time-lapse videos without the need for any manual morphokinetic annotation or blastocyst morphology assessment. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The contribution of time-lapse imaging in effective embryo selection is promising. Existing algorithms for the analysis of time-lapse imaging are based on morphology and morphokinetic parameters that require subjective human annotation and thus have intrinsic inter-reader and intra-reader variability. Deep learning offers promise for the automation and standardization of embryo selection. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective analysis of time-lapse videos and clinical outcomes of 10 638 embryos from eight different IVF clinics, across four different countries, between January 2014 and December 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The deep learning model was trained using time-lapse videos with known FH pregnancy outcome to perform a binary classification task of predicting the probability of pregnancy with FH given time-lapse video sequence. The predictive power of the model was measured using the average area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve over 5-fold stratified cross-validation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The deep learning model was able to predict FH pregnancy from time-lapse videos with an AUC of 0.93 [95% CI 0.92-0.94] in 5-fold stratified cross-validation. A hold-out validation test across eight laboratories showed that the AUC was reproducible, ranging from 0.95 to 0.90 across different laboratories with different culture and laboratory processes. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is a retrospective analysis demonstrating that the deep learning model has a high level of predictability of the likelihood that an embryo will implant. The clinical impacts of these findings are still uncertain. Further studies, including prospective randomized controlled trials, are required to evaluate the clinical significance of this deep learning model. The time-lapse videos collected for training and validation are Day 5 embryos; hence, additional adjustment would need to be made for the model to be used in the context of Day 3 transfer. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The high predictive value for embryo implantation obtained by the deep learning model may improve the effectiveness of previous approaches used for time-lapse imaging in embryo selection. This may improve the prioritization of the most viable embryo for a single embryo transfer.

It is essential to understand the development of skills to refuse sexual experience in early adolescence in order to reduce disparities associated with early sexual debut among AI/AN youth. Familial, social, and individual factors can act as protective influences on adolescent sexual experience; however, in other settings, research has shown that frequent residential mobility disrupts these protective influences and may increase the likelihood of adolescent sexual activity. AI/AN youth are highly mobile, and, as a result, may be especially vulnerable to increased sexual risk. To date, no prior study has considered the impact of residential mobility on AI/AN youth sexual experience, nor the influence on precursors that reduce initiation of sex. We used data from a longitudinal study of AI/AN youth attending all middle schools from a Northern Plains reservation from 2006–2009 to estimate a structural equation model based on a cultural and age adapted theoretical framework. The tested model included frequent residential mobility as the independent variable and sex refusal self-efficacy as the dependent variable. Mediating variables included factors related to individual risks, psychological well-being, and social supports. Results indicate a direct association between residential mobility and sex refusal self-efficacy (-.29, p = 0.05) and an indirect association mediated by deviant peers (-.08, p = .05). Other mediating variables did not provide insight on the mechanism by which residential mobility influences skills to refuse sexual intercourse among AI/AN youth in early adolescence. Findings provide evidence for an association between residential mobility and precursors to sexual experience suggesting augmenting sexual health interventions for highly mobile youth. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescence; adolescent; Alaska Native; American Indian; article; conceptual framework; controlled study; dependent variable; drug efficacy; female; human; independent variable; juvenile; longitudinal study; male; middle school; migration; precursor; psychological well-being; self concept; sexual health; sexual intercourse; skill; social support; structural equation modeling; adolescent behavior; high risk behavior; peer group; physiology; population dynamics; psychology; sexual behavior; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Alaska Natives; Female; Health Risk Behaviors; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Peer Group; Population Dynamics; Self Efficacy; Sexual Behavior","","","","South, Scott J., Residential mobility and the onset of adolescent sexual activity, Journal of Marriage and Family, 67, 2, pp. 499-514, (2005); Journal of Marriage and the Family, (1994); Baumer, Eric P.S., Community effects on youth sexual activity, Journal of Marriage and Family, 63, 2, pp. 540-554, (2001); Crowder, Kyle D., Do residential conditions explain the relationship between living arrangements and adolescent behavior?, Journal of Marriage and Family, 66, 3, pp. 721-738, (2004); Sucoff, Clea A., Neighborhood context and the risk of childbearing among metropolitan-area black adolescents, American Sociological Review, 63, 4, pp. 571-585, (1998); Croy, Calvin D., Young adult migration from a Northern Plains Indian reservation: Who stays and who leaves, Population Research and Policy Review, 28, 5, pp. 641-660, (2009); Gasper, Joseph M., Coming and going: Explaining the effects of residential and school mobility on adolescent delinquency, Social Science Research, 39, 3, pp. 459-476, (2010); Desire to Move and Residential Mobility 20102011, (2015); Hamilton, Brady E., Continued Declines in Teen Births in the United States, 2015, National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, 259, pp. 1-8, (2016); Kann, Laura K., Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance - United States, 2015, MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 65, 6, pp. 1-180, (2016)","","Public Library of Science plos@plos.org","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","31206559","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067308803"

Material and method: A general data protection regulation-compliant electronic survey was sent by e-mail to the 617 radiologists registered in the French departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (93 radiology residents and 524 senior radiologists), from both public and private institutions. The survey included 42 questions focusing on AI in radiology, and data were collected between January 16th and January 31st, 2019. The answers were analyzed together by a senior radiologist and a radiology resident. Results: A total of 70 radiology residents and 200 senior radiologists participated to the survey, which corresponded to a response rate of 43.8% (270/617). One hundred ninety-eight radiologists (198/270; 73.3%) estimated they had received insufficient previous information on AI. Two hundred and fifty-five respondents (255/270; 94.4%) would consider attending a generic continuous medical education in this field and 187 (187/270; 69.3%) a technically advanced training on AI. Two hundred and fourteen respondents (214/270; 79.3%) thought that AI will have a positive impact on their future practice. The highest expectations were the lowering of imaging-related medical errors (219/270; 81%), followed by the lowering of the interpretation time of each examination (201/270; 74.4%) and the increase in the time spent with patients (141/270; 52.2%). Conclusion: While respondents had the feeling of receiving insufficient previous information on AI, they are willing to improve their knowledge and technical skills on this field. They share an optimistic view and think that AI will have a positive impact on their future practice. A lower risk of imaging-related medical errors and an increase in the time spent with patients are among their main expectations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Machine learning; Radiologists; Survey","adult; article; artificial intelligence; e-mail; expectation; female; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical error; perception; radiologist; radiology; resident; skill; aged; attitude to health; France; health personnel attitude; middle aged; self report; young adult; Adult; Aged; Artificial Intelligence; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radiology; Self Report; Young Adult","","","","Morris, K.

Clinical decision support (CDS) is a health information technology (IT) component that provides useful information to providers as healthcare is being delivered. We hypothesized that CDS incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR) could improve the recognition and management of adrenal crisis within the pediatric ED. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the impact of electronic CDS on the management of patients with known adrenal insufficiency (AI) presenting to two pediatric ED locations over a 19-month period with symptoms suggestive of adrenal crisis. Outcome variables assessed included the frequency of hydrocortisone (HC) administration, appropriateness of HC dosing, and timing to HC order placement and administration. Results: A total of 145 encounters were reviewed. When the electronic CDS was in place at the time of the ED visit, patients were nearly 3 times as likely to receive HC (p = 0.002). Among those patients who received HC, the presence of the CDS increased the likelihood of an appropriate 50-mg/m 2 dose of HC being given from 20 to 53% (p = 0.02). However, the CDS did not significantly reduce the time from ED arrival to HC order placement (p = 0.36) or administration (p = 0.59).

Eastern Martial Arts have a diverse motor structure and rules of sport competition. Traditional karate (KT) is a non-contact sport while taekwondo (Ta) is a contact sport and Ta competitors wear body armours compromising blow impact. Karate kyokushin (KK) competitors do not wear body protectors, which increases the risk of injuries, especially head injuries, resulting from kicks. In aikido (Ai), joint locks and reap techniques are counteroffensive, but they are not body-destructive. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis that young men practicing the aforementioned EMA differ in terms of selected personality traits. Material and Methods: The sample comprised males training KK, TK, Ta and Ai. Each group included 82 athletes (the total of 328 competitors). The mean age of the sample was 19-20 years and their training experience ranged from 5 to 8 years. In order to determine personality profile, two traits, namely: Impulsive-Sensation Seeking (Imp-SS) and Aggression-Hostility (Agg-Ho) assessed using Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) and three traits, namely Neuroticism (Nu), Extraversion (Ex), Psychoticism (Ps) assessed using Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R) were selected. Results: Among the four studied groups of EMA athletes, the highest mean values of empirical variables, namely: (Agg-Ho 5.0 ±3.32, Imp-SS 9.89 ±3.00 and Ps 7.87 ±4,96) were noted in KK group, while the lowest values obtained for Agg-Ho 4.67 ±2.34, Imp-SS 9.24 ±2.74, Ps 6.68 ±4.38) were noted in Ai group. The level of Agg-Ho in KK group was statistically significantly higher as compared with that obtained in Ai and KT groups. Moreover, significant between subject differences in the studied variables were noted in each group. Conclusions: The obtained indicators justify the conclusion that, according to social norms, the highest negative indicators of personality traits were obtained from KK group. A different personality profile was discovered in Ai group where more moderate physical forms of defensive workout are preferred. Thus, aikido and martial arts/com-bat sports preferring moderate and relatively moderate fighting techniques, referred to as life sports”, are recommended for effective enhancement of all health dimensions of survival ability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aggression; Aggressiveness; Kumite; Pain tolerance","","","","","Biernat, Elzbieta, Martial arts as a form of undertaking physical activity in leisure time analysis of factors determining participation of poles, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 15, 9, (2018); Supiński, Jan, Usefulness of the psychomotor tests for distinguishing the skill levels among older and younger judo athletes, Archives of Budo, 10, pp. 315-322, (2014); Pol J Sport Med, (2017); Blomqvist Mickelsson, Tony, Modern unexplored martial arts–what can mixed martial arts and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu do for youth development?, European Journal of Sport Science, 20, 3, pp. 386-393, (2020); Proceedings of the 1st World Congress on Health and Martial Arts in Interdisciplinary Approach, (2015); Thornton, Claire, A longitudinal exploration of pain tolerance and participation in contact sports, Scandinavian Journal of Pain, 16, pp. 36-44, (2017); Neuropharmacology, (2019); Reynès, Éric, Competitive martial arts and aggressiveness: A 2-yr. longitudinal study among young boys, Perceptual and Motor Skills, 98, 1, pp. 103-115, (2004); Endresen, Inger M., Participation in power sports and antisocial involvement in preadolescent and adolescent boys, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 46, 5, pp. 468-478, (2005); Lamarre, Brian W., Judo - The gentle way: A replication of studies on martial arts and aggression, Perceptual and Motor Skills, 88, 3, pp. 992-996, (1999)","","Medical Science International office@isl-science.com","","","","","","16438698","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079200471"

The purpose of this study is to examine cancer incidence rates and trends in the AI/AN population compared with the non-Hispanic white population in the United States for the years 2010 to 2015. Methods: Cases diagnosed during 2010 to 2015 were identified from population-based cancer registries and linked with the Indian Health Service (IHS) patient registration databases to describe cancer incidence rates in non-Hispanic AI/AN persons compared with non-Hispanic whites (whites) living in IHS purchased/referred care delivery area counties. Age-adjusted rates were calculated for the 15 most common cancer sites, expressed per 100,000 per year. Incidence rates are presented overall as well as by region. Trends were estimated using joinpoint regression analyses. Results: Lung and colorectal cancer incidence rates were nearly 20% to 2.5 times higher in AI/AN males and nearly 20% to nearly 3 times higher in AI/AN females compared with whites in the Northern Plains, Southern Plains, Pacific Coast, and Alaska. Cancers of the liver, kidney, and stomach were significantly higher in the AI/AN compared with the white population in all regions. We observed more significant decreases in cancer incidence rates in the white population compared with the AI/AN population. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the importance of examining cancer disparities between AI/AN and white populations. Disparities have widened for lung, female breast, and liver cancers. Impact: These findings highlight opportunities for targeted public health interventions to reduce AI/AN cancer incidence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Alaska; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer registry; Caucasian; colorectal cancer; female; health care delivery; health disparity; human; kidney cancer; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sex difference; stomach cancer; United States; adolescent; adult; aged; child; ethnology; incidence; infant; middle aged; neoplasm; newborn; preschool child; register; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alaskan Natives; Child; Child, Preschool; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Incidence; Indians, North American; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Registries; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","Cronin, Kathleen A., Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, part I: National cancer statistics, Cancer, 124, 13, pp. 2785-2800, (2018); Wiggins, Charles L., Cancer among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, 1999-2004, Cancer, 113, 5 SUPPL., pp. 1142-1152, (2008); White, Mary C., Disparities in cancer mortality and incidence among American Indians and Alaska natives in the United States, American Journal of Public Health, 104, SUPPL. 3, pp. S377-S387, (2014); Jim, Melissa A., Racial misclassification of American Indians and Alaska natives by Indian health service contract health service delivery area, American Journal of Public Health, 104, SUPPL. 3, pp. S295-S302, (2014); Espey, David K., Methods for improving cancer surveillance data in American Indian and Alaska Native populations, Cancer, 113, 5 SUPPL., pp. 1120-1130, (2008); Hankey, Benjamin F., The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program: A national resource, Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention, 8, 12, pp. 1117-1121, (1999); Thoburn, Kathleen K., Case completeness and data accuracy in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries, Cancer, 109, 8, pp. 1607-1616, (2007); Lynch, Charles F., Cancer registry problems in classifying invasive bladder cancer, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 83, 6, pp. 429-433, (1991); Arias, Elizabeth, The validity of race and Hispanic origin reporting on death certificates in the United States., Vital and Health Statistics, Series 2: Data Evaluation and Methods Research, 148, pp. 1-23, (2008); Henderson, Jeffrey A., Prostate cancer incidence among American Indian and Alaska Native men, US, 1999-2004, Cancer, 113, 5 SUPPL., pp. 1203-1212, (2008)","","American Association for Cancer Research Inc.","","","","","","15387755; 10559965","","CEBPE","31575554","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072848351"

In the first assessment of the cases, ATLS protocols recommends use of triage decision scheme consisting of parametres of abnormal physiologic findings, anatomic injury site, pathogenic mechanism of injury, concomitant diseases and conditions, and activation of trauma teams in line with these criteria. The aim of this study is to evaluate TEWS(Triage Early Warning Score) as a marker for predicting mortality in trauma patients who presented to Emergency Services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 381 trauma patients aged ≥ 18 years who admitted to the Emergency Service and met criteria of ATLS protocol were included in the study.TEWS values of the patients were calculated using patients'data included in the study forms. Impact level was scrutinized using multivariant logistic regression test. Level of statistical significance was accepted as p<0.05. RESULTS: In the prediction of survival and ex patient rates; significant effectiveness of TEWS was observed [0.973 (0.944- 1)] (p<0.05). In the ROC analysis maximum TEWS AUC value was [0.930 (0.895-0.966)] with a cut-off value of 5 points. TEWS scores of 17.2% (66/381) of the patients who were discharged were above 5 points. These patients had undergone intubation (n= 21; 35%), tube thoracostomy (n= 16; 26.6%), transfusion of blood products (n= 29; 48.3%), and emergency surgery (n=16; 26.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Triage Early Warning Score is effective in the prediction of emergency treatment, and prognosis in trauma patients hospitalized in the emergency services, and it may identify patients under risk. We think that Triage Early Warning Score together with ATLS protocol can be used as an easily applicable triage warning trauma score in trauma patients. KEY WORDS: Mortality, Scoring systems, Trauma.; Gli infortuni post-traumatici sono tra i motivi più frequenti di ricorso ai servizi di pronto soccorso (ER). Nella prima valutazione dei casi, i protocolli ATLS raccomandano l’uso di uno schema decisionale di triage costituito da parametri fisiologici anormali, dal sito delle lesioni anatomiche, dal meccanismo patogenetico della lesione, da eventuali comorbilità e attivazione di trauma teams in linea con questi criteri. Lo scopo di questo studio è valutare il TEWS (Triage Early Warning Score) quale indicatore di previsione della mortalità in questo tipo di pazienti vittime di trauma. Sono stati studiati 381 pazienti traumatizzati di età ≥ 18 anni, accettati al servizio di emergenza con criteri corrispondenti al protocollo ATLS. I valori del TEFS di questi pazienti sono stati calcolati utilizzando i dati compresi nelle schede dello studio. Il livello di impatto è stato esaminato utilizzando il test di regressione logistica multivariante, accettando come statisticamente significativo il p <0,05. Per la previsione della sopravvivenza è stata rilevata una significativa efficacia di TEWS [0.973 (0.944-1)] (p<0.05). Nell’analisi ROC il valore AUC massimo di TEWS era [0,930 (0,895-0,966)] con un valore soglia di 5 punti. I punteggi di TEWS del 17,2% (66/381) dei pazienti che sono stati dimessi erano superiori a 5 punti. Questi pazienti sono stati sottoposti a intubazione (n= 21; 35%), drenaggio toracotomico (n= 16; 26,6%), trasfusione di emodrerivati (n= 29; 48,3%) e chirurgia d’urgenza (n= 16; 26,6%). In conclusione il punteggio di preallarme del triage è efficace nella previsione del trattamento di emergenza e nella prognosi nei pazienti traumatizzati ospedalizzati nei servizi di emergenza e può identificare i pazienti a rischio. Riteniamo che il punteggio di preallarme di Triage insieme al protocollo ATLS possa essere usato come un punteggio traumatico di triage facilmente applicabile nei pazienti traumatizzati.

Data Sources Systematic review conducted in the Virtual Health Library (VHL), PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. The descriptors used were: Questionnaire, Questionnaires, Quality of life, validation, validation Studies, anal incontinence, fecal incontinence and constipation. The search was performed between December 26, 2017 and the beginning of January 2018. The limits used were female gender. Selection of Studies Initially, 5,143 articles were obtained in the search. The articles of validation for Portuguese of questionnaires for the evaluation of the impact of FI/AI on the QoL of women were considered eligible. Data Collection The article search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines. Data Synthesis Of the 5,143 articles, only 2 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria: Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) and the Wexner scale (WS). The FIQL evaluates the QoL related to FI, not covering flatus incontinence. The WS assesses flatus incontinence and the severity of the AI. The WS obtained an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.932 and a Cronbach α coefficient > 0.90. The FIQL obtained intraexaminer and interexaminer reproducibility ranging from 0.929 to 0.957 and from 0.944 to 0.969, respectively. Conclusions The WS and the FIQL have satisfactory reliability and validity for use during gynecological consultations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fecal incontinence; quality of life; review; surveys and questionnaires; validation studies","adolescent; adult; aged; constipation; feces incontinence; female; human; meta analysis; middle aged; Portugal; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; severity of illness index; validation study; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Constipation; Fecal Incontinence; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Validation Studies as Topic; Young Adult","","","","Hayden, Dana M., Fecal incontinence: Etiology, evaluation, and treatment, Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery, 24, 1, pp. 64-70, (2011); Haylen, Bernard T., An International Urogynecological Association (IUGA)/International Continence Society (ICS) joint report on the terminology for female pelvic floor dysfunction, International Urogynecology Journal, 21, 1, pp. 5-26, (2010); Smith, Tovia Martirosian, Factors associated with quality of life among women with fecal incontinence, International Urogynecology Journal, 24, 3, pp. 493-499, (2013); Bezerra, Leonardo Robson Pinheiro Sobreira, Prevalence of unreported bowel symptoms in women with pelvic floor dysfunction and the impact on their quality of life, International Urogynecology Journal, 25, 7, pp. 927-933, (2014); Rev Port Coloproct, (2010); de Souza Santos, Claudia Regina, [Prevalence of fecal incontinence in the urban population of Pouso Alegre, Minas Gerais, Brazil]., Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da USP, 45, 1, pp. 180-186, (2011); Departamento De Ciencia E Tecnologia Diretrizes Metodologicas Estudos De Avaliao Econmica De Tecnologias Em Sade, (2009); Fonseca, Andrea Moura Rodrigues Mac Iel, Cultural adaptation and validation of the Wexner scale in patients with anal incontinence in a Brazilian population, International Urogynecology Journal, 27, 6, pp. 959-963, (2016); Yusuf, Sonia Ahlaim Ibrahim, Evaluation of quality of life in anal incontinence: Validation of the questionnaire FIQL (Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life), Arquivos de Gastroenterologia, 41, 3, pp. 202-208, (2004); Rev Port Coloproctol, (2015)","","Georg Thieme Verlag iaorl@iaorl.org","","","","","","18069339; 01007203","","","30822807","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064756372"

The odds of regular child toothbrushing were 49.10 times higher when the parent brushed their own teeth regularly (confidence interval (CI)=11.46–188.14; p<0.001). Parental toothbrushing had a strong positive association with the belief that oral health is as important as physical health. This research endorses parent-focused toothbrushing interventions to reduce AI/AN early childhood caries rates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Early childhood caries; Native Americans; oral health; oral hygiene; parent; self-report","adolescent; adult; aged; Alaska Native; attitude to health; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; health; health behavior; human; infant; male; middle aged; mouth hygiene; preschool child; tooth brushing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alaska Natives; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Health; Oral Hygiene; Parents; Toothbrushing; Young Adult","","","","Oral Health in America A Report of the Surgeon General, (2000); Hirsch, Gary B., A simulation model for designing effective interventions in early childhood caries, Preventing Chronic Disease, 9, 3, (2012); Mattheus, Deborah J., Vulnerability related to oral health in early childhood: A concept analysis, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 66, 9, pp. 2116-2125, (2010); Mobley, Connie C., The Contribution of Dietary Factors to Dental Caries and Disparities in Caries, Academic Pediatrics, 9, 6, pp. 410-414, (2009); Policy on early childhood caries (ECC): classifications, consequences, and preventive strategies., Pediatric Dentistry, 30, 7 Suppl, pp. 40-43, (2008); Hochbaum, Godfrey M., Why people seek diagnostic x-rays., Public Health Reports, 71, 4, pp. 377-380, (1956); Davidson, Pamela L., Socio-behavioral determinants of oral hygiene practices among USA ethnic and age groups., Advances in Dental Research, 11, 2, pp. 245-253, (1997); Nakazono, Terry T., Oral health beliefs in diverse populations., Advances in Dental Research, 11, 2, pp. 235-244, (1997); Pahel, Bhavna Talekar, Parental perceptions of children's oral health: The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS), Health and Quality of Life Outcomes, 5, (2007); Tinanoff, Norman, Update on Early Childhood Caries Since the Surgeon General's Report, Academic Pediatrics, 9, 6, pp. 396-403, (2009)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd. michael.wagreich@univie.ac.at","","","","","","22423982; 12399736","","","30857502","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062765894"

Method: Logistic regression predicted the experience of discrimination and its reported negative effect on academics. Additional models examined the effect of attending a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). Results: Discrimination was experienced by 5–15% of students, with all racial/ethnic minority groups examined- including Black, Hispanic, Asian, AI/NA/NA, and Multiracial students- more likely to report discrimination relative to White students. Of students who experienced discrimination, 15–25% reported it had negatively impacted their academic performance, with Hispanic and Asian students more likely to report negative impacts relative to White students. Attending an MSI was associated with decreased experiences of discrimination. Conclusion: Students from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected by discrimination, with negative impacts for academic performance that are particularly marked for Hispanic and Asian students. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Counseling; discrimination; ethnicity; mental health; race","academic achievement; adult; article; Asian; college student; counseling; ethnic difference; ethnic group; ethnicity; female; Hispanic; human; human experiment; male; mental health; race; spring; adolescent; African American; ancestry group; Caucasian; ethnology; minority group; psychology; racism; socioeconomics; statistical model; student; university; young adult; Academic Performance; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Continental Population Groups; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Minority Groups; Racism; Socioeconomic Factors; Students; Universities; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the Commonwealth Research Center (SCDMH82101008006).","Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Groups, (2010); Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Groups 2016, (2016); Johnson, Dawn R., Examining the Effects of Stress and Campus Climate on the Persistence of Students of Color and White Students: An Application of Bean and Eaton's Psychological Model of Retention, Research in Higher Education, 55, 1, pp. 75-100, (2014); Strategies to Empower Low Income and Minority Students in Gaining Admission to and Paying for College, (2008); Walton, Gregory M., A brief social-belonging intervention improves academic and health outcomes of minority students, Science, 331, 6023, pp. 1447-1451, (2011); How Minority Students Experience College Implications for Planning and Policy, (2002); Higher Education Handbook of Theory and Research, (2013); Hill, Nancy E., Negotiating the American dream: The paradox of aspirations and achievement among Latino students and engagement between their families and schools, Journal of Social Issues, 66, 1, pp. 95-112, (2010); New Directions for Institutional Research, (2006); Eimers, Mardy T., Minority and nonminority adjustment to college: Differences or similarities?, Research in Higher Education, 38, 1, pp. 77-97, (1997)","","Routledge aabs@uw.edu","","","","","","07448481","","JACHE","29565755","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047249001"

To elucidate the impact of social context on pain processing, we investigated how group membership, one of the most important social context factors, shapes pain relief behaviourally and neurally in humans undergoing functional neuroimaging. Participants repeatedly received pain relief from a member of their own group (ingroup treatment) or a member of a disliked outgroup (outgroup treatment). We observed a decrease in pain ratings and anterior insula (AI) pain responses after outgroup treatment, but not after ingroup treatment. Moreover, path analyses revealed that the outgroup treatment induced a stronger relief learning in the AI, which in turn altered pain processing, in particular if the participant entered the treatment with a negative impression toward the outgroup individual. The finding of enhanced analgesia after outgroup treatment is relevant for intergroup clinical settings. More generally, we found that group membership affects pain responses through neural learning and we thus elucidate one possible mechanism through which social context impacts pain processing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anterior insula; classical conditioning; expectation; ingroup bias; outgroup support; reinforcement","disease; imaging method; mental health; neurology; social behavior; analgesia; association; brain; electrostimulation; ethnic group; human; learning; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; perception; physiology; psychology; reinforcement; Switzerland; young adult; Analgesia; Brain; Cues; Electric Stimulation; Ethnic Groups; Humans; Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pain; Reinforcement (Psychology); Social Perception; Young Adult","","","","Au Yeung, Siu Tsin, Partial reinforcement, extinction, and placebo analgesia, Pain, 155, 6, pp. 1110-1117, (2014); Büchel, Christian, Placebo analgesia: A predictive coding perspective, Neuron, 81, 6, pp. 1223-1239, (2014); Colloca, Luana, How placebo responses are formed: A learning perspective, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 366, 1572, pp. 1859-1869, (2011); Egorova-Brumley, Natalia, Not seeing or feeling is still believing: Conscious and non-conscious pain modulation after direct and observational learning, Scientific Reports, 5, (2015); Lui, Fausta, Neural bases of conditioned placebo analgesia, Pain, 151, 3, pp. 816-824, (2010); Seymour, Ben, Opponent appetitive-aversive neural processes underlie predictive learning of pain relief, Nature Neuroscience, 8, 9, pp. 1234-1240, (2005); Jensen, Karin Birgitta, Classical conditioning of analgesic and hyperalgesic pain responses without conscious awareness, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 25, pp. 7863-7867, (2015); Jepma, Marieke, Conceptual Conditioning: Mechanisms Mediating Conditioning Effects on Pain, Psychological Science, 26, 11, pp. 1728-1739, (2015); Wager, Tor Dessart, The neuroscience of placebo effects: Connecting context, learning and health, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 16, 7, pp. 403-418, (2015); Schwarz, Katharina A., Rethinking Explicit Expectations: Connecting Placebos, Social Cognition, and Contextual Perception, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 20, 6, pp. 469-480, (2016)","","Royal Society Publishing sales@royalsoc.ac.uk","","","","","","09628452; 14712954","","PRLBA","30257910","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054519855"

Various studies have demonstrated higher alcohol consumption among AI/AN women during pregnancy compared with other groups. This study intends to understand the milieu within which such consumption patterns flourish. The study utilizes qualitative and quantitative data from the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) CHOICES Program, a tribally run public health program that aims to reduce alcohol-exposed pregnancy preconceptually in AI women. Methods: Alcohol consumption pattern (n = 264) is analyzed using descriptive statistics. Consumption patterns included average drinks consumed daily, their choice of drinks (beer, whiskey, wine, etc.), how much money participants were spending on alcohol and amount of calories consumed from alcohol. Qualitative data analysis included open coding of data from decisional balance exercise of the CHOICES program that looked at good things and not so good things about participants’ drinking. Results: Women reported drinking an average of 12 drinks daily, ranging between 1 and 86. Women drinking at home spent a median of $4,320 and $12,960 if drinking at a bar. A median of 1,200 calories per day from alcohol was reported. More women reported drinking beer compared with other types of alcohol within a domestic setting. Qualitative data analysis identified positive and negative aspects of drinking among the participants of OST CHOICES Program. Positive aspects included escaping from problems, socializing, and relaxation. Negative aspects included impact on families and domestic violence. Conclusions: While understanding their milieu, our study also unraveled different struggles (such as violence, peer pressure, financial burden, and depression) encountered by Native women in their daily lives. According to the participants, positive aspects of drinking outweigh the negative aspects and they viewed their drinking as a solution and not a problem. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alaska Native; Alcohol; American Indian; CHOICES Intervention; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder; Qualitative; Women","alcohol; adult; Alaska Native; alcohol consumption; American Indian; Article; beer; caloric intake; controlled study; data analysis; exercise; female; fetal alcohol syndrome; human; human experiment; priority journal; qualitative analysis; whiskey; wine; adolescent; drinking behavior; ethnology; male; middle aged; prevention and control; psychology; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Data Analysis; Female; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult","","alcohol, 64-17-5","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and publication of this article.

Asthma onset during childhood and adolescence is further associated with other health issues, particularly psychiatric conditions. To understand causal mechanisms by which developmental asthma may lead to altered behavior, brain and health trajectories, we developed a mouse model of developmental allergic asthma. In the current study, we tested for potential long-term effects of developmental asthma on adult lung function and behavior and brain gene expression associated with emotion and stress regulation. We manipulated airway inflammation (AI) and methacholine (MCH)-induced bronchospasm (resulting in labored breathing, LB) in young male and female BALB/cJ mice and measured adult outcomes 3 months after final asthma manipulations. Results indicated that allergen exposure, used to cause AI, and which ended on post-natal day 56 (P56), led to persistent lung AI, mucus buildup and gene expression related to allergic asthma 3 months after final allergen exposure. In addition, at this same age, early allergen exposure led to altered brain gene expression related to stress regulation (prefrontal corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1, Crhr1 and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor, GR) and serotonin function (brainstem serotonin transporter, SERT). On the other hand, LB events during development led to altered anxiety-related behavior. Importantly, sex and pre-asthma fear-related behavior (ultrasonic vocalization, USV rates) modulated these adult outcomes. Asthma that develops during childhood/adolescence may have long-term impacts on emotion and stress regulation mechanisms, and these influences may be moderated by sex and pre-asthma temperament. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anxiety; Asthma; House dust mite; Inflammation; Methacholine; Ultrasonic vocalization","allergen; collagen; corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1; cytokine; glucocorticoid receptor; serotonin transporter; adolescent; adult; allergic asthma; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety; Article; bronchospasm; causal attribution; controlled study; cytokine production; depression; disease course; emotionality; exposure; female; gene expression regulation; hippocampus; lung function; male; mouse; neuromodulation; nonhuman; perinatal period; respiratory tract inflammation; temperament; vocalization","","collagen, 9007-34-5","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R21MH092667-01A1) and the Pennsylvania State Institute for Neuroscience.

Our previous work demonstrated that community exposures to mine waste increase the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease, as well as the likelihood of developing multiple chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease. Exposure to various environmental metals is associated with elevated oxidative stress, which is considered a contributor to these and other chronic disease states. The purpose of the current research was to assess potential associations between exposure to uranium and arsenic and evidence for increased oxidative stress as measured by urinary F<inf>2</inf> -isoprostanes in pregnant women enrolled in the Navajo Birth Cohort Study. The current study also included an analysis of zinc as a potential mediator of oxidative stress in the study population. Urinary arsenic and uranium, serum zinc and urinary F<inf>2</inf> -isoprostanes were measured for each study participant at enrollment. Study participants were pregnant women with median age of 26.8; 18.9% were enrolled in the 1st trimester, 44.7% were enrolled in the 2nd trimester, and 36.4% were enrolled in the 3rd trimester. Median urinary metal levels were 5.5 and 0.016 µg/g creatinine for arsenic and uranium, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis indicated a significant association between arsenic exposure and the lipid peroxidation product 8-iso-prostaglandin F<inf>2α</inf> controlling for zinc and trimester. No associations were detected with uranium despite evidence that levels were in the Navajo Birth Cohort samples were 2.3 times the median reported for women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-12). Zinc was not found to have any causal mediation of the effects of the other metals on oxidative stress. The current work is consistent with other studies that have detected an association between arsenic and elevated oxidative stress. In contrast to arsenic, uranium did not appear to increase oxidative stress response in this study population. These findings are relevant to assessing the potential human impact of chronic exposure to mixed metal waste from abandoned uranium mines. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI/AN; Arsenic; isoprostanes; Navajo Birth Cohort Study; oxidative stress; uranium; zinc","8 isoprostaglandin F2 alpha; arsenic; isoprostane derivative; uranium; zinc; biological marker; adult; Article; controlled study; female; first trimester pregnancy; human; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; lipid peroxidation; Navajo (people); oxidative stress; population research; pregnant woman; priority journal; urinalysis; zinc blood level; adolescent; American Indian; analysis; blood; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; pollutant; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; urine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Arsenic; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Oxidative Stress; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Uranium; Young Adult; Zinc","","8 isoprostaglandin F2 alpha, 27415-26-5; arsenic, 7440-38-2; uranium, 7440-61-1; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; Arsenic; Biomarkers; Environmental Pollutants; Uranium; Zinc","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [Competing Revision to 1R01ES021100 NIH Revision Awards for Creating Virtual Consortium for Translational/ Transdisciplinary Environmental Research (ViCTER)(R01); Navajo Birth Cohort Study: CDC/NCEH/ATSDR 5 U01 TS000135-05 and 1P50ES026102 UNM Center for Native Environmental Health Equity NIEHS/NIMHD P50ES026102 & USEPA (#83615701).

American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth initiate sex prior to age 13 more often than other U.S. youth, contributing to current inequalities in sexual health. Identifying what factors were associated with lifetime sexual experience among AI/AN youth can inform the development of primary prevention programming to delay sexual initiation, alleviate the costs of early sexual activity, and improve sexual health outcomes in this population. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 267 AI youth ages 13–19, recruited from a rural, reservation-based community. We used multivariate logistic regression models to estimate associations between independent variables and lifetime sexual experience (vaginal and/or anal sex) across the following categories: sociodemographic, knowledge, attitudes/perceptions, beliefs, intentions, skills, behaviors, and theoretical constructs. The sample was 56.2% female, mean age 15.1 years (SD = 1.7), and 22.5% were sexually experienced. In our final model, condom use self-efficacy (attitude/perception factor) and intentions to remain abstinent until marriage (intention factor) were associated with lower odds of lifetime sexual experience. Age (sociodemographic factor), intention to have sex (intention factor), use of any contraception (behavior factor), and higher response efficacy (theoretical construct) were associated with lifetime sexual experience. Of these, intention to have sex was the strongest indicator. These results both corroborate and contrast with other research conducted among rural, reservation-based AI/AN youth. Our findings show programs targeting intentions may have the greatest impact among reservation-based AI youth, and justify program delivery stratified by age group in this setting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian/Alaska Native; Pregnancy; Sexual experience; Sexually transmitted infection; Youth","adolescent; age; American Indian; attitude to health; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; human; male; psychology; rural population; self concept; sexual abstinence; sexual behavior; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Age Factors; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indians, North American; Logistic Models; Male; Rural Population; Self Efficacy; Sexual Abstinence; Sexual Behavior; Young Adult","","","Funding text 1: Funding This work was supported by the Native American Research Centers for Health (Grant Number U26IHS300286/03).; Funding text 2: The authors respectfully acknowledge the youth, families, community members, and tribal leaders from the participating tribal community for their innovation and leadership in pioneering research strategies.

The aim of this study was to provide more insight on the transition out of elite sport by assessing and comparing the extent of AI and self-esteem in an active group (AG) and a retired group (RG) of Paralympic athletes. Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were additionally assessed in the AG and RG, respectively. A non-probability sampling method was used to recruit active and retired Paralympic athletes (AG, n = 43; RG, n = 41, where 35 retired voluntarily and 6 retired involuntarily) with visual or physical impairments, from Dutch-, English-, Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking countries. Participants completed an electronic survey with questionnaires to assess the study variables mentioned above. Descriptive analysis, comparisons (Mann–Whitney U test and t-test) and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were performed for the statistical analysis. Scores of AI were significantly lower in the RG (44.6 ± 9.6) compared to the AG (49.4 ± 8.9); t(82) = 2.36, p =.021, d = 0.51. No differences in self-esteem were found between RG and AG; however, within the RG, athletes who involuntarily retired (21 ± 7.1) had significantly lower self-esteem scores than those who retired voluntarily (25.2 ± 4.2); t(39) = 2.04, p =.049, d = 0.73. In conclusion, free choice upon retirement can positively influence the athletes’ self-esteem, whereas a strong AI may negatively influence the retirement process, as it was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (ρ =.409, p =.008). These findings can have practical implications for sport psychologists to better support their athletes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Disability sport; emotional problems; retirement; self-esteem; transition out of sport","adolescent; adult; athlete; cross-sectional study; depression; disabled person; female; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; retirement; self concept; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Athletes; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disabled Persons; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retirement; Self Concept; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","We want to acknowledge the persons who helped with participant recruitment.

Little is known regarding the effects of these programs on American Indian (AI) populations. The purpose of this study is to characterize the impact of a patient navigation program on AI cervical cancer patients at a tertiary care center. Methods: A retrospective review of all AI cervical cancer patients receiving navigation services and a cohort of AI patients treated prior to navigation services was performed. Additional comparisons were made between those with and without Indian Health Service (IHS) funding. Summary statistics were used to describe demographic, clinical characteristics, treatment, and survivorship across groups. Results: Of 55 patients identified, 34 received navigation and 21 did not. In navigated patients, median age was 46 years (27–80 years) compared with 42 years (17–68 years) in pre-navigation patients (p = 0.53). There was no difference between stage at diagnosis (p = 0.73). No difference was noted in treatment received between groups (p = 0.48). Distance traveled for treatment between groups did not differ (p = 0.46). Median time to initiation of treatment was not different between groups, 30.5 days vs. 27.5 days (p = 0.18). Among patients with IHS funding, navigation services did not alter time to initiation of treatment (p = 0.57), and there was no difference in completion of prescribed therapy between groups (92% navigated vs 100% pre-navigation). Conclusions: Navigation services for AI cervical cancer patients did not alter initiation or completion of treatment. Navigation programs may provide less tangible benefits to AI cervical cancer patients and further study is warranted. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","American Indian; Cervical cancer; Patient navigation","antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; American Indian; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chemoradiotherapy; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; female; funding; health service; human; major clinical study; medical record review; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; navigation service; patient care; post hoc analysis; priority journal; retrospective study; survivorship; tertiary care center; uterine cervix cancer; adolescent; ethnology; patient compliance; procedures; public health service; United States; uterine cervix tumor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Patient Navigation; Retrospective Studies; United States Indian Health Service; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Young Adult","","","","Ryerson, Aliza Blythe, Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2012, featuring the increasing incidence of liver cancer, Cancer, 122, 9, pp. 1312-1337, (2016); Javid, Sara Hughes, Guideline-concordant cancer care and survival among American Indian/Alaskan Native patients, Cancer, 120, 14, pp. 2183-2190, (2014); Espey, David K., Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2004, featuring cancer in American Indians and Alaska Natives, Cancer, 110, 10, pp. 2119-2152, (2007); Watson, Meg, Cervical cancer incidence and mortality among American Indian and Alaska native women, 1999û2009, American Journal of Public Health, 104, SUPPL. 3, pp. S415-S422, (2014); American Indian and Alaska Native Population 2010, (2012); Indian Health Service the Federal Health Program for American Indians and Alaska Natives, (2017); Native Health Database Full Text, (1997); Hohl, Sarah D., Satisfaction with cancer care among American Indian and Alaska Natives in Oregon and Washington State: a qualitative study of survivor and caregiver perspectives, Supportive Care in Cancer, 24, 6, pp. 2437-2444, (2016); Krok-Schoen, Jessica L., Cancer care delivery and women's health: The role of patient navigation, Frontiers in Oncology, 6, JAN, (2016); Ko, Naomi Yu, Racial and ethnic differences in patient navigation: Results from the Patient Navigation Research Program, Cancer, 122, 17, pp. 2715-2722, (2016)","","Academic Press Inc. apjcs@harcourt.com","","","","","","10956859; 00908258","","GYNOA","29605056","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044147396"

The primary data from 91 poultry farms (duck farms, broiler chicken and backyard poultry), four hatcheries and 90 backwater boat owners were collected through pre-tested schedules. The secondary data on transfer payments and expenditure incurred to control AI were collected from developmental departments and were analysed. The estimated loss (culling live birds, eggs and feed destruction) per duck farm was USD 9,181, USD 3,889 and USD 156 in case of commercial farms reared for meat, dual-purpose and backyard farms, respectively. The loss incurred by small-scale broiler and backyard poultry farms was USD 453 and USD 40, respectively. The loss incurred by large and small duck hatcheries was USD 11,963 and USD 5,790, respectively, due to culling of hatchlings, young birds and destroying eggs. The government invested USD 744,890 to contain the disease spread through massive culling, surveillance and monitoring of poultry and humans due to zoonotic nature of the disease. A sharp market reaction on own and substitute product prices and eight weeks’ time lag in price recovery was observed. The consequential impact on tourism especially for the backwater boat operators amounted to a loss of USD 2,280/boat due to fall in tourist inflow. Since, control measures are post-incidence, it is necessary to adopt appropriate preventive bio-security measures at the farm level besides periodical screening of domestic birds in migratory birds’ flyway locations like Kuttanad to reduce the AI burden on various stakeholders including government. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","avian influenza; culling; duck farming; government expenditure; hatcheries; impact; India; Kerala; Kuttanad; tourism; transfer payments","adult; animal husbandry; Article; avian influenza; developing country; disease surveillance; disinfection; duck; economic aspect; electricity; epidemic; female; government; hatching; human; India; male; middle aged; nonhuman; poultry product; public health; agricultural land; animal; bird disease; blood; chicken; cost of illness; economics; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemiology; veterinary; virology; virus antibody; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Chickens; Cost of Illness; Disease Outbreaks; Ducks; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Farms; Influenza in Birds; Poultry Diseases","","Antibodies, Viral","The authors thank the Kerala State Animal Husbandry and Health & Family Welfare Departments and their officials, field veterinarians and para-veterinarians for their assistance during data collection.

Objectives: The study aims were to evaluate 1) the contribution of AI and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) to newborn iron endowment, 2) hepcidin as a biomarker to distinguish AI from IDA among pregnant women, and 3) risk factors for specific etiologies of maternal anemia. Methods: We measured hematologic biomarkers in maternal blood at 12 and 32 wk of gestation and in cord blood from a randomized trial of praziquantel in 358 pregnant women with Schistosoma japonicum in The Philippines. IDA was defined as anemia with serum ferritin <30 ng/mL and non-IDA (NIDA), largely due to AI, as anemia with ferritin ≥30 ng/mL. We identified cutoffs for biomarkers to distinguish IDA from NIDA by using area under the curve (AUC) analyses and examined the impact of different causes of anemia on newborn iron status (primary outcome) by using multivariate regression modeling. Results: Of the 358 mothers, 38% (n = 136) had IDA and 9% (n = 32) had NIDA at 32 wk of gestation. At 32 wk of gestation, serum hepcidin performed better than soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in identifying women with NIDA compared with the rest of the cohort (AUCs: 0.75 and 0.70, respectively) and in identifying women with NIDA among women with anemia (0.73 and 0.72, respectively). The cutoff that optimally distinguished women with NIDA from women with IDA in our cohort was 6.1 μg/L. Maternal IDA, but not NIDA, was associated with significantly lower newborn ferritin (114.4 ng/mL compared with 148.4 μg/L; P = 0.042). Conclusions: Hepcidin performed better than sTfR in identifying pregnant women with NIDA, but its cost may limit its use. Maternal IDA, but not NIDA, is associated with decreased newborn iron stores, emphasizing the need to identify this cause and provide iron therapy.

Materials and methods: Included for evaluation were all patients treated with adhesively bonded monolithic single-tooth restorations made of silicate or lithium disilicate ceramics; allowing a maximum four missing teeth and a facial feldspathic veneering of LDS anterior crowns. After treatment, patients have been enrolled in a recall program for dental check-ups including quality assessment of the restorations. Patients answered the oral health impact profile (OHIP-14) at their last visit. Results: Seventeen patients (mean age = 35 ± 18 years) were observed up to 16.5 years (mean: 6.2 ± 3.8 years). 12 out of 450 restorations failed due to core fracture (n = 7), tooth fracture (n = 2), one secondary caries, one chip-off grade 3, and one fixed dental prosthesis due to discomfort. The overall mean survival rate of the single-tooth restorations was estimated 99.4% at 5 and 91.4% at 10 years. The overall mean success rate was estimated 92.6% at 5 and 81.4% at 10 years, mainly due to chip-offs and crack formation (27 out of 31 relative failures). The mean annual failure rates (AFR) range between 1.5 and 2% over the years, but non-AI patients were affected more frequently by early technical complications in the facial veneering of anteriors, resulting in an AFR ranging between 5.2 and 4%. Quality assessment revealed stable color, form and marginal integrity in all patients up to ten years. The distribution of OHIP values is comparable to the representative sample of healthy patients. Conclusion: Adhesively bonded single-tooth restorations provided a high clinical quality in the long-run. However, while the survival and success were excellent in AI patients, restorations in non-AI patients were affected by a higher complication rate, likely related to a higher risk profile due to a history of bruxism and tooth wear. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ceramics; Dental adhesives; Dental crowns; Dental enamel hypoplasia; Permanent dentition","dental material; dental porcelain; lithia disilicate; tooth cement; adult; amelogenesis imperfecta; bruxism; ceramics; chemistry; complication; dental bonding; dental marginal adaptation; dental restoration; dental veneer; dentition; female; health; human; incisor; male; middle aged; pathology; periodontal index; procedures; survival rate; time factor; tooth disease; tooth fracture; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Amelogenesis Imperfecta; Bruxism; Ceramics; Dental Bonding; Dental Cements; Dental Marginal Adaptation; Dental Materials; Dental Porcelain; Dental Restoration Failure; Dental Veneers; Dentition; Female; Humans; Incisor; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Health; Periodontal Index; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Tooth Fractures; Tooth Wear; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","Dental Cements; Dental Materials; Dental Porcelain; lithia disilicate","","Klink, Andrea, The challenge of erosion and minimally invasive rehabilitation of dentitions with BEWE grade 4, Quintessence International, 47, 5, pp. 365-372, (2016); Groten, Martin, Complex all-ceramic rehabilitation of a young patient with a severely compromised dentition: A case report, Quintessence International, 40, 1, pp. 19-27, (2009); Grütter, Linda, Full-mouth adhesive rehabilitation in case of severe dental erosion, a minimally invasive approach following the 3-step technique., The European journal of esthetic dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Esthetic Dentistry, 8, 3, pp. 358-375, (2013); Muts, Erik Jan, Tooth wear: A systematic review of treatment options, Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, 112, 4, pp. 752-759, (2014); Pour, Reza Saeidi, Rehabilitation of a patient with amelogenesis imperfecta using porcelain veneers and CAD/CAM polymer restorations: A clinical report, Quintessence International, 46, 10, pp. 843-852, (2015); Sabandal, Martin Mariano Isabelo, Amelogenesis imperfecta: review of diagnostic findings and treatment concepts, Odontology / the Society of the Nippon Dental University, 104, 3, pp. 245-256, (2016); Meyers, Ian Arthur, Minimum intervention dentistry and the management of tooth wear in general practice, Australian Dental Journal, 58, SUPPL.1, pp. 60-65, (2013); Sabahipour, Laleh, A questionnaire based study to investigate the variations in the management of tooth wear by UK and prosthodontists from other countries., European Journal of Prosthodontics and Restorative Dentistry, 17, 2, pp. 61-66, (2009); Edelhoff, Daniel, Minimally invasive treatment options in fixed prosthodontics, Quintessence International, 47, 3, pp. 207-216, (2016); Mesko, Mauro Elias, Rehabilitation of severely worn teeth: A systematic review, Journal of Dentistry, 48, pp. 9-15, (2016)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03005712","","JDENA","29275170","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042277404"

This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 18 U.S. states for 2014. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics. Reporting Period Covered: 2014. Description of System: NVDRS collects data from participating states regarding violent deaths. Data are obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, supplemental homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data from 18 states that collected statewide data for 2014 (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident. Results: For 2014, a total of 22,098 fatal incidents involving 22,618 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 18 states included in this report. The majority of deaths were suicides (65.6%), followed by homicides (22.5%), deaths of undetermined intent (10.0%), deaths involving legal intervention (1.3%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths ( < 1%). The term ""legal intervention"" is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement. Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), non-Hispanic whites, persons aged 45-54 years, and males aged ≥ 75 years. Suicides were preceded primarily by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem or a crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were higher among males and persons aged < 1 year and 15-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black and AI/AN males. Homicides primarily were precipitated by arguments and interpersonal conflicts, occurrence in conjunction with another crime, or related to intimate partner violence (particularly for females). When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, it was most often either an acquaintance/friend or an intimate partner. Legal intervention death rates were highest among males and persons aged 20-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males and Hispanic males. Precipitating factors for the majority of legal intervention deaths were alleged criminal activity in progress, the victim reportedly using a weapon in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem, an argument or conflict, or a recent crisis. Deaths of undetermined intent occurred more frequently among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and AI/AN males, and persons aged 30-54 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 10-24 years; these deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and were most often precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2014. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged < 65 years, males, and certain minority populations. The primary precipitating factors for homicides and suicides were intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health and substance abuse problems, and recent crises. Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, North Carolina VDRS data were used to improve case ascertainment of pregnancy-associated suicides, Wisconsin VDRS data were used to develop the statewide suicide prevention strategy, and Colorado VDRS data were used to develop programs and prevention strategies for suicide among veterans. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce the impact of violence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; cause of death; child; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health survey; homicide; human; infant; injury; male; marriage; middle aged; mortality; preschool child; public health service; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; suicide; United States; very elderly; violence; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Homicide; Humans; Infant; Male; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Population Surveillance; Sex Distribution; Suicide; Violence; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult","","","Contributors to this report included participating state Violent Death Reporting Systems; participating state agencies, including state health departments, vital registrars' offices, coroners'/medical examiners' offices, crime laboratories, and local and state law enforcement agencies; partner organizations, including the Safe States Alliance, American Public Health Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, National Association of Medical Examiners, National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, National Violence Prevention Network, Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and Association of State and Territorial Health Officials; federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives); other stakeholders, researchers, and foundations, including Harvard University School of Public Health and the Joyce Foundation; and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and National Center for Health Statistics, CDC","Web Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Wisqars, (2006); Blair, Janet M., The national violent death reporting system: Overview and future directions, Injury Prevention, 22, pp. i6-i11, (2016); Reducing the Burden of Injury Advancing Prevention and Treatment, (1999); Quickfacts United States; Krug, Etienne G., The world report on violence and health, The Lancet, 360, 9339, pp. 1083-1088, (2002); International Classification of Diseases, (2007); National Violent Death Reporting System Nvdrs Coding Manual Revised Online, (2016); Murphy, Sherry L., Deaths: final data for 2010., National Vital Statistics Reports, 61, 4, pp. 1-117, (2013); US Census Populations with Bridged Race Categories, (2015); Technical Packages for Violence Prevention Using Evidence Based Strategies in Your Violence Prevention Efforts, (2017)","","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cdcinfo@cdc.gov","","","","","","15460738; 15458636","","","29389917","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042783103"

Several studies have highlighted the consequences of noise on children’s learning and performance at school. This study investigates the relationship between noise judgment in school goers aged 11-18 and noise measurements aimed at evaluating their exposure at school. For this purpose, a questionnaire was administered to 521 individuals in 28 classrooms in eight schools of four cities in Italy, with different environmental characteristics. Using a Likert-type scale, a selected set of responses related to noise generated an Annoyance Index (AI) score for each student and a classroom median score (MAI). From the noise data acquired, a global noise score (GNS) was assigned to each classroom. A higher AI was found in industrialized areas and among younger students. No significant differences in noise judgment were found by gender. A significant inverse correlation was described between MAI and GNS, thus the better the acoustic quality of the classrooms, the less the perceived noise and annoyance. The results show that noise perception and consequent disturbance are highly correlated with classroom acoustics, and confirm that annoyance represents the most widespread subjective response to noise. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annoyance; Annoyance index; Children; Environment; Health; Noise; Questionnaire; Risk perception","child health; health impact; noise; questionnaire survey; risk perception; secondary education; student; young population; acoustics; annoyance; article; child; city; decision making; female; gender; hearing; high school; human; human experiment; Italy; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; noise measurement; questionnaire; school child; adolescent; diagnosis; emotion; environmental exposure; etiology; mental stress; psychology; school; Acoustics; Adolescent; Auditory Perception; Child; Emotions; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Noise; Schools; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The GIOCONDA project was funded by the EU Environment Direction General under the LIFE + funding scheme—LIFE13 ENV/IT/000225, from June 2014 to November 2016.

This may be particularly true for infants/young children and their caregivers. The aim of this study was to quantify the interaction between the child's perceived general health as assessed by the newly developed Toddler and Infant Questionnaire (TANDI) on the reporting of the caregiver's own HRQoL as assessed by the EQ-5D-3 L. Methods: A sample of 187 caregivers participated. A total of 60 caregivers of acutely-ill (AI) and 60 caregivers of chronically-ill (CI) children were recruited from a children's hospital. The 67 caregivers of general population (GP) children were recruited at a pre-school. Each caregiver completed the proxy rating of their child's HRQoL on the TANDI (The TANDI is an experimental HRQoL instrument, modelled on the EQ-5D-Y proxy, for children aged 1-36 months), which comprises of six dimensions of health and a rating of general health on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The caregiver completed the EQ-5D-3 L, a self-report measure of their own HRQoL. Forward stepwise regression models were developed with 1) the VAS score of the caregiver and 2) the VAS score of the child as dependent variables. The independent variables for the caregiver included dummy variables for the presence or absence of problems on the EQ-5D-3 L and the VAS score of the child. The independent variables for the child included dummy variables for each TANDI dimension and the VAS of the caregiver. Results: The TANDI results indicated that in five of the six dimensions AI children had more problems than the other two groups and the GP children were reported to have a significantly higher VAS than the other two groups. The child's VAS was significantly correlated with the caregiver's VAS in all groups, but most strongly in the AI group. The preference based scores (using the UK TTO tariff) were only correlated in the AI group. The inclusion of the child's VAS increased the variance accounted for 11% of the VAS score of the caregiver. Anxiety and depression was the only dimension which accounted for more variance (18%). Similarly the perceived health state, VAS of the caregiver accounted for 14% of the variance in the child's VAS, second only to problems with play (25%). Conclusion: There does indeed appear to be a strong relationship between the VAS scores of the children and their caregivers. The perceived general health of the child influences the caregivers reporting of their general health, more than their own report of experiencing pain or discomfort or problems with mobility. Thus, improving the HRQoL of the very young child may improve the caregiver's HRQoL as well. Conversely, if the caregiver has a lower perceived HRQoL this may result in a decrement in the reported VAS of the child, independent of the presence or absence of problems in the different dimensions. This improvement is not currently captured by Cost Utility Analysis (CUA). It is recommended that future research investigates this effect with regards to CUA calculations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Caregivers; Children; Cost utility analysis; EQ-5D; Health related quality of life; HRQoL; Infants","acute disease; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; caregiver; child; child health; chronic disease; controlled study; correlation analysis; depression; EQ 5D 3 L; health status; human; infant; quality of life; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; South Africa; Toddler and Infant Questionnaire; visual analog scale; adolescent; female; male; middle aged; newborn; nursing; preschool child; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Caregivers; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Female; Health Status; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","Torrance, George W., Preferences for health outcomes and cost-utility analysis, American Journal of Managed Care, 3, 5 SUPPL. 1, pp. S8-S20, (1997); Torrance, George W., Utility measurement in healthcare: The things i never got to, PharmacoEconomics, 24, 11, pp. 1069-1078, (2006); Weinstein, Milton C., QALYs: The basics, Value in Health, 12, SUPPL. 1, pp. S5-S9, (2009); Neumann, Peter J., Preference-based measures in economic evaluation in health care, Annual Review of Public Health, 21, pp. 587-611, (2000); Hoefman, Renske J., How to include informal care in economic evaluations, PharmacoEconomics, 31, 12, pp. 1105-1119, (2013); Brouwer, Werner B.f., The CarerQol instrument: A new instrument to measure care-related quality of life of informal caregivers for use in economic evaluations, Quality of Life Research, 15, 6, pp. 1005-1021, (2006); Al-Janabi, Hareth, A framework for including family health spillovers in economic evaluation, Medical Decision Making, 36, 2, pp. 176-186, (2016); Bobinac, Ana, Health effects in significant others: Separating family and care-giving effects, Medical Decision Making, 31, 2, pp. 292-298, (2011); Wittenberg, Eve, Evidence of spillover of illness among household members: EQ-5D scores from a US sample, Medical Decision Making, 33, 2, pp. 235-243, (2013); Lavelle, Tara A., Variation in the spillover effects of illness on parents, spouses, and children of the chronically ill, Applied Health Economics and Health Policy, 12, 2, pp. 117-124, (2014)","","BioMed Central Ltd. info@biomedcentral.com","","","","","","14777525","","","29321017","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040341075"

It provides both opportunities for its promotion and exposure to risk factors, such as periods spent in unemployment or in precarious jobs. In recent decades, the Italian labour market has been reformed structurally, with the aim of shifting social policies towards a model of flexicurity. This research reviews these reforms from an equity perspective, with a focus on the distribution of labour related health risks, and on the role played by welfare measures. To this end, we introduce a labour market inclusion indicator, which sums up those who are employed to those who are unemployed but receiving welfare benefits. We use this indicator to identify the main social groups “suffocated” by the crisis and assess the ability of welfare measures to “rescue” them. Results show that the crisis had a heterogeneous impact, affecting young workers and females the most. The welfare state was most effective in protecting those less affected by the economic downturn, thus increasing inequalities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Labour market; Labour market policy; Recession; Social inclusion; Social policy","","","","","Albertini, Marco, Care policies in Italy between a national frozen landscape and local dynamism, pp. 133-156, (2015); Il Sostegno Al Reddito Dei Disoccupati Note Sullo Stato Dell Arte Tra Riformismo Strisciante Inerzie Dell Impianto Categoriale E Incerti Orizzonti Di Flexicurity Isae, (2009); Welfare State all Italiana, (1984); Agostini, Chiara, Occupational Welfare: An opportunity to recalibrate the Italian welfare model?, Politiche Sociali, 1, 2, pp. 263-279, (2014); Ascoli, Ugo, The Italian welfare state after 20 years of institutional change, Stato e Mercato, 3, pp. 429-464, (2012); Ammortizzatori Sociali Regole Deroghe Prospettive, (2009); Barbieri, Paolo, Employment protection legislation, labour market dualism, and inequality in Europe, European Sociological Review, 32, 4, pp. 501-516, (2016); Barbieri, Paolo, Le conseguenze sociali della flessibilizzazione del mercato del lavoro in Italia, Stato e Mercato, 74, pp. 291-321, (2005); Flex Insecurity Perche in Italia La Flessibilita Diventa Precarieta, (2009); Politics of Work Family Policy Reforms in Germany and Italy, (2017)","","Franco Angeli Edizioni ufficiostampa@francoangeli.it Viale Monza 106 Milan 2012720127","","","","","","03925048","","","","Italian","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054343823"

To assess the prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their association with behavioral health in American Indian (AI) and non-AI populations in South Dakota. Methods. We included the validated ACE questionnaire in a statewide health survey of 16,001 households. We examined the prevalence of ACEs and behavioral health conditions in AI and non-AI populations and associations between ACEs and behavioral health. Results. Compared with non-AIs, AIs displayed higher prevalence of ACEs including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction and had a higher total number of ACEs. For AIs and non-AIs, having six or more ACEs significantly increased the odds for depression, anxiety, PTSD, severe alcohol misuse, and smoking compared with individuals with no ACEs. Conclusions. American Indians in South Dakota experience more ACEs, which may contribute to poor behavioral health.

They are aware of losing their health and independence. Therefore, acceptance of illness (AI) is important and allows the patient to adjust to new situation and alleviates negative emotions Methods: The aim of study was to assess the impact of AI and other socioclinical variables on hemodialysis patients' quality of life (QoL). The study included 100 patients aged 20-85 (M = 57), treated with hemodialysis for at least 2 years. Two validated instruments were used: the Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. Results: High, moderate and low level of AI was found for 15, 61 and 24 patients, respectively. The QoL increased with the AI score. In physical domain, it reached 69.8 ± 12.4 in the high AIS group, 54.2 ± 15.3 in the moderate AIS group and 42.7 ± 12.3 in the low AIS group (P < 0.001). The psychological domain scores were 70.3 ± 12.8, 57.2 ± 15.0 and 49.7 ± 11.8 (P < 0.001), respectively. The environmental domain scores were 68.8 ± 13.3,59.0 ± 12.6 and 53.0 ± 11.6 (P < 0.001), respectively. AIS scores were positively correlated with QoL in three domains: physical (r = 0.549; P < 0.0001), psychological (r = 0.505; P < 0.0001) and environmental (r = 0.444; P < 0.0001). In multiple-factor analysis, AI was independent predictors in physical domains (β = +0.210), psychological domain (β = +0.402) and environmental domain (β = +0.204). No correlation or predictive value was found for the social relationship domain, however. Conclusions: Patients on dialysis have moderate-to-low AI. AI is an independent predictor positively correlated with QoL in all domains except for social relationships. The social and psychological support for dialyzed patient might improve their HRQoL and illness acceptance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; aged; attitude to health; coping behavior; female; hemodialysis; human; male; middle aged; procedures; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; very elderly; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Renal Dialysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Levey, Andrew S., Definition and classification of chronic kidney disease: A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)z, Kidney International, 67, 6, pp. 2089-2100, (2005); Eckardt, Kai Uwe, Definition and Classification of CKD: The Debate Should Be About Patient Prognosis-A Position Statement From KDOQI and KDIGO, American Journal of Kidney Diseases, 53, 6, pp. 915-920, (2009); Przew Lek, (2007); Forum Nefrologiczne, (2008); Probl Pielg, (2013); Hygeia Public Health, (2012); Fructuoso, Mónica Rodrigues, Quality of life in chronic kidney disease, Nefrologia, 31, 1, pp. 91-96, (2011); Polska Medycyna Rodzinna, (2004); Prob Lek, (2006); Zyga, Sofia, Management of Pain and Quality of Life in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Undergoing Hemodialysis, Pain Management Nursing, 16, 5, pp. 712-720, (2015)","","Oxford University Press jnl.info@oup.co.uk","","","","","","11011262; 1464360X","","EJPHF","28339523","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017242604"

Condom use intention is an established predictor of condom use and is an important construct for evaluating interventions among adolescents who are not yet sexually active. This analysis evaluated the impact of Respecting the Circle of Life (RCL), a sexual and reproductive health intervention for AI adolescents, on predictors of condom use intention. Methods We utilized a cluster randomized controlled trial design to evaluate RCL among 267 AIs ages 13–19. We examined baseline psychosocial and theoretical variables associated with condom use intention. Generalized estimating equation regression models determined which baseline variables predictive of condom use intention were impacted. Results Mean sample age was 15.1 years (standard deviation 1.7) and 56% were female; 22% had initiated sex. A larger proportion of RCL versus control participants had condom use intention post intervention (relative risk [RR] = 1.39, p =.008), especially younger (ages 13–15; RR = 1.42, p =.007) and sexually inexperienced adolescents (RR = 1.44, p =.01); these differences attenuated at additional follow-up. Baseline predictors of condom use intention included being sexually experienced, having condom use self-efficacy, as well as response efficacy and severity (both theoretical constructs). Of these, the RCL intervention significantly impacted condom use self-efficacy and response efficacy. Conclusions Results demonstrate RCL intervention efficacy impacting variables predictive of condom use intention at baseline, with greater differences among younger, sexually inexperienced adolescents. To sustain intervention impact, future RCL implementation should reinforce education and training in condom use self-efficacy and response efficacy and recruit younger, sexually inexperienced AI adolescents. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adolescent; American Indian; Condom use intention; Reproductive health; Sexual health","adolescent; adult; American Indian; Article; condom use; controlled study; female; follow up; human; intervention study; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; reproductive health; secondary analysis; self concept; sexual health; adolescent behavior; attitude to health; behavior; cluster analysis; condom; procedures; sexual behavior; sexual education; statistics and numerical data; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Cluster Analysis; Condoms; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Indians, North American; Intention; Male; Reproductive Health; Sex Education; Sexual Behavior; Young Adult","","","","Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2011, (2012); Walker, Frances J., HIV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Primary and Secondary Syphilis among American Indians and Alaska Natives Within Indian Health Service Areas in the United States, 2007–2010, Journal of Community Health, 40, 3, pp. 484-492, (2015); Heywood, Wendy, Associations Between Early First Sexual Intercourse and Later Sexual and Reproductive Outcomes: A Systematic Review of Population-Based Data, Archives of Sexual Behavior, 44, 3, pp. 531-569, (2015); Kaestle, Christine Elizabeth, Young age at first sexual intercourse and sexually transmitted infections in adolescents and young adults, American Journal of Epidemiology, 161, 8, pp. 774-780, (2005); 14 and Younger the Sexual Behavior of Young Adolescents, (2003); undefined, (2015); Martin, Joyce A.G., Births: Final data for 2011, National Vital Statistics Reports, 62, 1, (2013); Eaton, Danice K., Youth risk behavior surveillance - United States, 2011., MMWR Surveillance Summaries, 61, 4, pp. 1-162, (2012); Tingey, Lauren, The Respecting the Circle of Life trial for American Indian adolescents: Rationale, design, methods, and baseline characteristics, AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV, 27, 7, pp. 885-891, (2015); Tingey, Lauren, Respecting the circle of life: One year outcomes from a randomized controlled comparison of an HIV risk reduction intervention for American Indian adolescents, AIDS Care - Psychological and Socio-Medical Aspects of AIDS/HIV, 27, 9, pp. 1087-1097, (2015)","","Elsevier USA","","","","","","18791972; 1054139X","","JADHE","28034609","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009212149"

Comprehensive health care services, including commercial tobacco cessation treatments, are difficult to access for many AI/AN individuals due to poverty, the rural distribution of tribal territories, cultural barriers and the lack of funding for these programs. Due, in part, to these health care gaps, AI/AN communities are disproportionally affected by nicotine dependence and associated chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. Methods: We report on data from National Jewish Health that provides telephonic tobacco cessation services for 14 states in the United States. We examine how AI/AN callers who were predominately AI callers differ from their counterparts (i.e., callers identifying as other ethnic groups) in terms of demographic characteristics, commercial tobacco use history, rates of emotional or mental health issues, and rates of chronic illness. Results: Findings from the quitline analyses show a higher rate of preadolescent onset of commercial tobacco use in the AI/AN callers. AI/AN callers are also more likely to live with another commercial tobacco user. Results demonstrate that AI/AN callers are disproportionately impacted by mental health challenges, including high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Similarly, AI/AN callers report more chronic medical issues including diseases of the lungs and cardiovascular system. Conclusions: These findings stress the critical need for tailored efforts to better reach AI/AN commercial tobacco users who are considering treatment, in order to make meaningful gains in commercial tobacco cessation for this vulnerable population. Implications: These findings demonstrate the disproportionate impact of commercial tobacco use on the AI/AN population who utilizes quitline services. These data stress the critical need for tailored efforts to better reach AI/AN commercial tobacco users who are considering treatment, in order to make meaningful gains in commercial tobacco cessation for this vulnerable population. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; age distribution; Alaska Native; American Indian; anxiety; Article; asthma; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; commercial tobacco use; controlled study; demography; depression; emotional disorder; ethnic difference; female; geographic distribution; health care access; heart infarction; human; hypertension; lung cancer; male; medical history; mental stress; middle aged; miscellaneous named groups; onset age; personalized medicine; prevalence; priority journal; quitline caller; sex difference; smoking; smoking cessation; smoking habit; telephonic tobacco cessation service; United States; vulnerable population; young adult; aged; Alaska; epidemiology; ethnology; health care disparity; hotline; prevention and control; procedures; utilization; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Hotlines; Humans; Indians, North American; Middle Aged; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Young Adult","","","","Jamal, Ahmed, Current cigarette smoking among adults - United States, 2005-2014, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 64, 44, pp. 1232-1240, (2015); Choi, Won S., Culturally-Tailored Smoking Cessation for American Indians: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial, Trials, 12, (2011); Mowery, Paul D., Disparities in Smoking-Related Mortality Among American Indians/Alaska Natives, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 49, 5, pp. 738-744, (2015); An Introduction to Indian Nations in the United States, (2015); Daley, Christine Makosky, Tobacco has a purpose, not just a past"": Feasibility of developing a culturally appropriate smoking cessation program for a pan-tribal native population, Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 20, 4, pp. 421-440, (2006); Galloway, James M., Cardiovascular health among American Indians and Alaska Natives: Successes, challenges, and potentials, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 29, 5 SUPPL. 1, pp. 11-17, (2005); Broken Promises Evaluating the Native American Health Care System, (2004); Plescia, Marcus G., Lung cancer deaths among American Indians and Alaska natives, 1990-2009, American Journal of Public Health, 104, SUPPL. 3, pp. S388-S395, (2014); Abbott, Patrick J., Comorbid alcohol/other drug abuse and psychiatric disorders in adult american indian and alaska natives: A critique, Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly, 26, 3, pp. 275-293, (2008); Deaths Final Data for 2007, (2010)","","Oxford University Press jnl.info@oup.co.uk","","","","","","1469994X; 14622203","","NTREF","27613942","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994520476"

Therefore, it is likely that female athletes involved in high-impact and in strong-effort activities are at risk for the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI). This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of UI and other PF dysfunctions (PFD) [anal incontinence (AI), symptoms of constipation, dyspareunia, vaginal laxity, and pelvic organ prolapse] in 67 amateur athletes (AT) compared with a group 96 of nonathletes (NAT). An ad hoc survey based on questions from reliable and valid instruments was developed to investigate the occurrence of PFD symptoms. The risk of UI was higher in AT group (odds ratio: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.50-5.61), mostly among artistic gymnastics and trampoline, followed by swimming and judo athletes. Whereas, AT group reported less straining to evacuate (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22-0.96), manual assistance to defecate (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.05-1.12), and a higher stool frequency (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.64) than NAT group. The occurrence of loss of gas and sexual symptoms was high for both groups when compared with literature, although with no statistical difference between them. Pelvic organ prolapse was only reported by nonathletes. Athletes are at higher risk to develop UI, loss of gas, and sexual dysfunctions, either practicing high-impact or strong-effort activities. Thus, pelvic floor must be considered as an entity and addressed as well. Also, women involved in long-term high-impact and strengthening sports should be advised of the impact of such activities on pelvic floor function and offered preventive PFD strategies as well. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anal incontinence; dyspareunia; epidemiology; Female athletes; pelvic floor dysfunction; pelvic organ prolapse; urinary incontinence; vaginal laxity; women's health","adolescent; adult; Brazil; constipation; cross-sectional study; dyspareunia; Fecal Incontinence; female; health survey; human; martial art; pelvic organ prolapse; physical education; sport; statistics and numerical data; swimming; Urinary Incontinence; volleyball; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Constipation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dyspareunia; Female; Gymnastics; Health Surveys; Humans; Martial Arts; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Sports; Swimming; Volleyball; Young Adult","","","","","","Blackwell Munksgaard info@mks.blackwellpublising.com","","","","","","16000838; 09057188","","SMSSE","26369504","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027935970"

Significant disparities exist for urban AI/ ANs compared with urban NHWs. More AI/ ANs are uninsured than NHWs, and more cited cost as the reason. More AI/ ANs cannot afford needed medical care and more AI/ ANs had not talked with a health care professional in the past year plus. Conclusions. Urban AI/ ANs have decreased health care utilization and greater barriers to access compared with NHWs.

While the number of breast cancer survivors is increasing, few studies have reported data on weight change beyond 5 years post-diagnosis. We investigated weight change and associated factors in long-term survivors of breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Medical records were reviewed on 1363 breast cancer patients and a total of 822 women who had survived beyond 5 years since diagnosis were included in the final analysis. The association between demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, cancer related factors (including time since diagnosis, treatment modality, pathologic stage, and hormone receptor status), and weight-change over 5 years were examined. Results: During an average 8.2 years of follow-up time, mean weight gain was 0.32kg (p = 0.017). 175 (21.3%) patients had gained more than 5% of their weight at diagnosis and their average gain was 5.55kg. Body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, aromatase inhibitor (AI) use, heavy drinking, and type of surgery were associated with relative weight gain (≥5%) in univariate analysis (all p-values<0.05). Patients who were non-obese at diagnosis showed weight gain, while those who were obese at diagnosis lost weight (0.78kg, -1.11kg, respectively, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, the non-obese group showed odds ratio of 2.7 (p = 0.001) relative to the obese group. Younger age group (age 18-54 years) showed odds ratio of 1.9 (p = 0.021) relative to the older age group (age 55-75 years), and patients who did not use AI showed odds ratio of 2.2 (p = 0.006) relative to women who did. Conclusion: Long-term breast cancer survivors who were non-obese at diagnosis are more likely to gain weight than obese survivors. Younger survivors and survivors who have never used AI are also likely to gain weight. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","aromatase inhibitor; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; adult; age; aged; anthropometry; Article; body mass; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survivor; demography; disease duration; drinking behavior; drug use; female; follow up; human; Korean (people); long term survival; major clinical study; mastectomy; medical record review; obesity; partial mastectomy; physical activity; risk factor; smoking; weight change; weight gain; weight reduction; adolescent; breast tumor; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; pathophysiology; physiology; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; survivor; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Retrospective Studies; Survivors; Time Factors; Weight Gain; Young Adult","","tamoxifen, 10540-29-1","","Vance, Vivienne A., Weight gain in breast cancer survivors: Prevalence, pattern and health consequences, Obesity Reviews, 12, 4, pp. 282-294, (2011); Goodwin, Pamela Jean, Adjuvant treatment and onset of menopause predict weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 17, 1, pp. 120-129, (1999); Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy, Weight gain in women diagnosed with breast cancer, Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 97, 5, pp. 519-526, (1997); Goodwin, Pamela Jean, Weight gain in early-stage breast cancer: Where do we go from here?, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 19, 9, pp. 2367-2369, (2001); Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy, Changes in weight, body composition, and factors influencing energy balance among premenopausal breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 19, 9, pp. 2381-2389, (2001); Irwin, Melinda L., Changes in body fat and weight after a breast cancer diagnosis: Influence of demographic, prognostic, and lifestyle factors, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 23, 4, pp. 774-782, (2005); Makari-Judson, Grace P., Longitudinal patterns of weight gain after breast cancer diagnosis: Observations beyond the first year, Breast Journal, 13, 3, pp. 258-265, (2007); Heasman, K.

The aim of this article is to investigate how AI/AN respond to particular graphic warning labels. Methods: The parent study recruited smokers, at-risk smokers and non-smokers from three different age groups (youths aged 13-17 years, young adults aged 18-24 years and adults aged 25+ years) and five population subgroups with high smoking prevalence or smoking risk. Using nine graphic labels, this study collected participant data in the field via an iPadadministered survey and card sorting of graphic warning labels. This paper reports on findings for AI/AN participants. Results: After viewing graphic warning labels, participants rated their likelihood of talking about smoking risks to friends, parents and siblings higher than their likelihood of talking to teachers and doctors. Further, this study found that certain labels (eg, the label of the toddler in the smoke cloud) made them think about their friends and family who smoke. Conclusions: Given the influence of community social networks on health beliefs and attitudes, health communication using graphic warning labels could effect change in the smoking habits of AI/AN community members. Study findings suggest that graphic labels could serve as stimuli for conversations about the risks of smoking among AI/AN community members, and could be an important element of a peer-to-peer smoking cessation effort. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adolescent; adult; Alaska Native; American Indian; clinical study; conversation; family study; friend; health belief; human; medical information; prevalence; sibling; smoke; smoking cessation; smoking habit; social network; speech; stimulus; teacher; tobacco use; toddler; young adult; adverse effects; emotion; ethnology; female; interpersonal communication; male; packaging; psychology; smoking; statistical model; tobacco; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Alaska Natives; Communication; Emotions; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Logistic Models; Male; Product Labeling; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Products; Young Adult","","","This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute and the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act grant number 3P50-CA05815.

The aim was to evaluate the relationships of changes in facial pain, temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and oral health-related quality-of-life (OHRQoL) in adults who underwent orthodontic or orthodontic/surgical treatment. Methods. Sixty-four patients (46 women, 18 men, range 18-64 years) with severe malocclusion and functional problems were treated in Oulu University Hospital. Of these, 44 underwent orthodontic-surgical and 20 orthodontic treatment. Data were collected with questionnaires and clinical stomatognathic examinations before and on average 3 years after treatment. The OHRQoL was measured with OHIP-14 (The Oral Health Impact Profile), the intensity of facial pain with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the severity of TMD with the Helkimos anamnestic (Ai) and clinical (Di) dysfunction indices. Results. A significant improvement was found in facial pain, signs and symptoms of TMD and OHRQoL after the treatment (p < 0.05). The decrease in VAS was associated with improvement in OHIP-14 severity (r = 0.296, p = 0.019). The correlations between changes in OHIP-14 severity and Ai and Di were not statistically significant. Conclusion. Treatment of severe malocclusion seemed to improve OHRQoL via decreased facial pain. Decreased facial pain was associated especially with improved OHRQoL dimensions of physical pain, physical disability and social disability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","orofacial pain; orthodontic treatment; orthognathic surgery; quality-of-life; Temporomandibular disorders","adolescent; adult; classification; Facial Pain; female; follow up; health; human; longitudinal study; male; malocclusion; maxilla osteotomy; middle aged; Open Bite; orthodontics; orthognathic surgery; Overbite; pain measurement; procedures; psychology; quality of life; sagittal split ramal osteotomy; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Malocclusion; Middle Aged; Oral Health; Orthodontics, Corrective; Orthognathic Surgical Procedures; Osteotomy, Le Fort; Osteotomy, Sagittal Split Ramus; Pain Measurement; Quality of Life; Young Adult","","","","Hassan, Ali H., Association of orthodontic treatment needs and oral health-related quality of life in young adults, American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, 137, 1, pp. 42-47, (2010); Frejman, Marcelo Weissbluth, Dentofacial deformities are associated with lower degrees of self-esteem and higher impact on oral health-related quality of life: Results from an observational study involving adults, Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 71, 4, pp. 763-767, (2013); Cunningham, Susan J., Quality of life and its importance in orthodontics, Journal of Orthodontics, 28, 2, pp. 152-158, (2001); Management of Temporomandibular Disorders and Occlusion, (1998); New Research on Fibromyalgia, (2006); Pullinger, Andrew G., A Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis of the Risk and Relative Odds of Temporomandibular Disorders as a Function of Common Occlusal Features, Journal of Dental Research, 72, 6, pp. 968-979, (1993); Huang, Gregory J., Risk factors for diagnostic subgroups of painful Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD), Journal of Dental Research, 81, 4, pp. 284-288, (2002); Michelotti, Ambra, Effect of occlusal interference on habitual activity of human masseter, Journal of Dental Research, 84, 7, pp. 644-648, (2005); Mohlin, Bengt Olof, TMD in relation to malocclusion and orthodontic treatment: A systematic review, Angle Orthodontist, 77, 3, pp. 542-548, (2007); Slade, Gary Douglas, Influence of psychological factors on risk of temporomandibular disorders, Journal of Dental Research, 86, 11, pp. 1120-1125, (2007)","","Taylor and Francis Ltd healthcare.enquiries@informa.com","","","","","","15023850; 00016357","","AOSCA","25936383","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946227901"

Initially reported as lethal in infancy, survival is possible into adulthood. We describe the molecular analysis and clinical phenotypes of five individuals from two consanguineous Brazilian families with attenuated Raine Syndrome with previously unreported features. Methods: The medical and dental clinical records were reviewed. Extracted deciduous and permanent teeth as well as oral soft tissues were analysed. Whole exome sequencing was undertaken and FAM20C cDNA sequenced in family 1. Results: Family 1 included 3 siblings with hypoplastic Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) (inherited abnormal dental enamel formation). Mild facial dysmorphism was noted in the absence of other obvious skeletal or growth abnormalities. A mild hypophosphataemia and soft tissue ectopic mineralization were present. A homozygous FAM20C donor splice site mutation (c.784 + 5 g > c) was identified which led to abnormal cDNA sequence. Family 2 included 2 siblings with hypoplastic AI and tooth dentine abnormalities as part of a more obvious syndrome with facial dysmorphism. There was hypophosphataemia, soft tissue ectopic mineralization, but no osteosclerosis. A homozygous missense mutation in FAM20C (c.1487C > T; p.P496L) was identified. Conclusions: The clinical phenotype of non-lethal Raine Syndrome is more variable, including between affected siblings, than previously described and an adverse impact on bone growth and health may not be a prominent feature. By contrast, a profound failure of dental enamel formation leading to a distinctive hypoplastic AI in all teeth should alert clinicians to the possibility of FAM20C mutations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amelogenesis imperfecta; Bone mineralization; Dentine; Ectopic mineralisation; FAM20C; Raine syndrome","phosphate; casein kinase I; FAM20C protein, human; scleroprotein; adolescent; adult; amelogenesis imperfecta; amino acid substitution; Article; autosomal recessive disorder; bone dysplasia; brain calcification; Brazilian; child; clinical article; consanguineous marriage; controlled study; DNA sequence; enamel hypoplasia; exome; exon skipping; face dysmorphia; FAM20C gene; female; gene; gingiva hyperplasia; homozygosity; human; human tissue; hypophosphatemia; male; malocclusion; microcephaly; micrognathia; midface hypoplasia; missense mutation; palate malformation; pedigree analysis; periodontal abscess; phosphaturia; Raine syndrome; school child; tooth discoloration; tooth malformation; tooth periapical disease; tooth pulp disease; young adult; case report; cleft palate; complication; exophthalmos; genetics; mouth disease; multiple malformation syndrome; mutation; nucleotide sequence; osteosclerosis; pedigree; phenotype; preschool child; Abnormalities, Multiple; Adolescent; Base Sequence; Casein Kinase I; Child; Child, Preschool; Cleft Palate; Exophthalmos; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Microcephaly; Mouth Abnormalities; Mutation; Osteosclerosis; Pedigree; Phenotype; Tooth Abnormalities; Young Adult","","phosphate, 14066-19-4, 14265-44-2; Casein Kinase I; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; FAM20C protein, human","The authors gratefully acknowledge the generosity of the families in participating in this study.

Because the condition is associated with negative social outcomes, this study evaluated oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), dental fear, and dental beliefs before and after early prosthetic crown therapy for AI during adolescence. Methods: The study included 69 patients with AI, aged 6-25 yr: 33 males and 36 females (mean age 14.5 ± 4.3); healthy controls (n = 80), patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP; n = 30), and patients with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH; n = 39). All matched in age and gender, and all but the CLP group insocioeconomic area. Patients completed three questionnaires measuring OHRQoL (OHIP-14), dental fear (CFSS-DS), and dental beliefs (DBS-R). Twenty-six patients with severe AI between ages 9 and 22 yr received crown therapy and completed the questionnaires twice: before and after therapy. Results: OHIP-14 scores were significantly higher among patients with AI (7.0 ± 6.7), MIH (6.8 ± 7.6) and CLP (13.6 ± 12.1) than healthy controls (1.4 ± 2.4) (p < 0.001). After crown therapy, quality of life problems in the 26 patients with severe AI decreased significantly, from 7.8 ± 6.1 to 3.0 ± 4.8 (p < 0.001). Early prosthetic therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment. Conclusions:OHRQoL increased after early crown therapy in patients with severe AI.

Instead, we compared average annual diagnosis rates per 100,000 population of HIV, chlamydia (CT), gonorrhea (GC), and primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, from 2007 to 2010, among AI/AN aged ≥13 years residing in 625 counties in the 12 Indian Health Service Areas, all AI/AN, and all races/ethnicities to address this gap. AI/AN comprised persons reported as AI/AN only, with or without Hispanic ethnicity. Out of 12 IHS Areas, 10 had higher case rates for CT, 3 for GC, and 4 for P&S syphilis compared to rates for all races/ethnicities. Eight Areas had higher HIV diagnosis rates than for all AI/AN, but HIV rates for all IHS Areas were lower than national rates for all races/ethnicities. Two IHS Areas ranking highest in rates of CT and GC and four Areas with highest P&S syphilis also had high HIV rates. STD and HIV rates among AI/AN were greater in certain IHS Areas than expected from observing national rates for AI/AN. Integrated surveillance of overlapping trends in STDs and HIV may be useful in guiding prevention efforts for AI/AN populations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alaska Natives; American Indians; Chlamydia; Gonorrhea; HIV/AIDS; Indian Health; Syphilis","adolescent; adult; American Indian; chlamydiasis; epidemiology; ethnology; female; gonorrhea; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; incidence; Inuit; male; middle aged; public health service; sexually transmitted disease; statistics and numerical data; syphilis; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.); Chlamydia Infections; Female; Gonorrhea; HIV Infections; Humans; Incidence; Indians, North American; Inuits; Male; Middle Aged; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Syphilis; United States Indian Health Service; Young Adult","","","","Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2002, (2003); HIV Surveillance Report, (2010); Indian Health Surveillance Report Sexually Transmitted Diseases 2009, (2012); Retrieved from, (2013); Retrieved from, (2012); Indian Health Surveillance Report Sexually Transmitted Diseases 2004, (2006); Indian Health Surveillance Report Sexually Transmitted Diseases 2007, (2009); Improving HIV Surveillance Among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, (2012); Census Bureau, (2012); Kaufman, Carol E., Within the hidden epidemic: Sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS among American Indians and Alaska natives, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 34, 10, pp. 767-777, (2007)","","Kluwer Academic Publishers barbara.b.bertram@gsk.com","","","","","","00945145; 15733610","","JCMHB","25371109","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939980972"

Methods: The project collected qualitative data at a reservation site and an urban site through 24 focus groups and 20 key informant interviews. Results: The reasons that AI youth choose to abstain or engage in sexual intercourse and utilize contraception vary based on gender ideologies defined by the adolescent's environment. These include social expectations from family and peers, defined roles within relationships, and gender empowerment gaps.

We conducted a survey among Mexican Oncologists to determine whether practice patterns may be responsible for these differences. Methods: A web-based survey was sent to 851 oncologists across Mexico using the Vanderbilt University REDCap database. Analyses of outcomes are reported using exact and binomial confidence bounds and tests. Results: 138 participants (18.6% of those surveyed) from the National capital and 26 Mexican states, responded. Respondents reported that 58% of newly diagnosed BC patients present with stage III-IV disease; 63% undergo mastectomy, 52% axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and 48% sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Chemotherapy is recommended for tumors > 1 cm (89%), positive nodes (86.5%), triple-negative (TN) (80%) and HER2 positive tumors (58%). Trastuzumab is prescribed in 54.3% and 77.5% for HER2 &#60; 1 cm and > 1 cm tumors, respectively. Tamoxifen is indicated for premenopausal hormone receptor (HR) positive tumors in 86.5% of cases and aromatase inhibitors (AI's) for postmenopausal in 86%. 24% of physicians reported treatment limitations, due to delayed or incomplete pathology reports and delayed or limited access to medications. Conclusions: Even though access to care programs have been recently applied nationwide, women commonly present with advanced BC, leading to increased rates of mastectomy and ALND. Mexican physicians are dissatisfied with access to appropriate medical care. Our survey detects specific barriers that may impact BC outcomes in Mexico and warrant further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Access to care; Breast cancer; Mexico; Patterns of care; Socioeconomic disparities; Survey","anthracycline; anthracycline plus taxane; aromatase inhibitor; bevacizumab; cisplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; fulvestrant; gemcitabine; hormone receptor; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; taxane derivative; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; Article; axillary lymph node; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; cancer risk; cancer staging; controlled study; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; health care quality; health survey; HER2 positive breast cancer; hormone receptor positive breast cancer; human; lymph node dissection; male; mastectomy; medical practice; Mexico; oncologist; partial mastectomy; premenopause; prescription; progesterone receptor positive breast cancer; sentinel lymph node biopsy; treatment duration; triple negative breast cancer; tumor volume; Breast Neoplasms; clinical practice; health care delivery; information processing; middle aged; pathology; physician; socioeconomics; young adult; Adult; Aged; Data Collection; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Middle Aged; Physician's Practice Patterns; Physicians; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult","","bevacizumab, 216974-75-3; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; epidermal growth factor receptor 2, 137632-09-8; fulvestrant, 129453-61-8; gemcitabine, 103882-84-4; tamoxifen, 10540-29-1; trastuzumab, 180288-69-1","We would like to thank and acknowledge all the Mexican physicians who participated in the survey.

Varicella hospitalization rates among the American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) population have not been previously documented.METHODS: We selected varicella-related hospitalizations, based on a published definition, from the Indian Health Service inpatient database for AI/ANs in the Alaska, Southwest and Northern Plains regions (1995-2010) and from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for the general US population (2007-2010). We analyzed average annual hospitalization rates prevaccine (1995-1998) and postvaccine (2007-2010) for the AI/AN population, and postvaccine for the general US population.RESULTS: From 1995-1998 to 2007-2010, the average annual varicella-related hospitalization rate for AI/ANs in the 3 regions decreased 95% (0.66-0.03/10,000 persons); the postvaccine rate appears lower than the general US rate (0.06, 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.06). The rate declined in all AI/AN pediatric age groups. Infants experienced the highest prevaccine (14.07) and postvaccine (0.83) hospitalization rates. Adults experienced low rates in both periods. Varicella vaccination rates in 19- to 35-month-old AI/AN children during fiscal years 2008-2010 were 88.1-91.0%.CONCLUSIONS: Widespread use of varicella vaccine in AI/AN children was accompanied by substantial declines in varicella-related hospitalizations consistent with high varicella vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe varicella outcomes.

Achieving timely pregnancies to allow calving every 12-14 months, therefore, is critical in modern dairy production. To meet the demands to produce suffi cient milk for fl uid and dairy products, various technologies are applied to enhance effi ciencies on the dairy farm. Artifi cial insemination (AI), embryo transfer, ultrasonographic and chemical detection of pregnancy, various monitors that detect or predict estrus, and handheld communication and testing devices allow managers to retrieve information to make cow-side decisions about health and reproductive status. Genomic testing of young potential sires or young heifers is now possible and can provide information about their genetic merit years before any progeny tests can be completed. In many countries, the challenge faced by dairy producers is their ability to afford these technologies in the face of rising feed and labor costs and volatile milk prices received at the farm gate. Government policies often place obstacles, trade barriers, and unfunded mandates that preclude operations from making a modest profi t. Unlike nearly all other manufacturing industries, agriculture producers have little control over the price received for their products. Therefore, dairy production is vulnerable to many uncontrolled factors including climate, government policy, economic conditions, and skilled labor shortages. It is clear that the impact of emerging and current reproductive technologies is critical to the management of dairy cattle to produce suffi cient milk to meet consumer demands for quality fl uid and dairy products. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artifi cial insemination; Assisted reproductive technologies; Estrusdetection aids; Genomics; Pregnancy diagnosis; Recombinant bovine somatotropin; Timed artifi cial insemination programs","recombinant growth hormone; agricultural worker; animal health; article; artificial insemination; biological monitoring; biotechnology; body fluid; breeding method; cattle farming; chemical analysis; climate; computer program; cost; dairy cattle; dairy industry; dairy product; dairying; echography; embryo transfer; estrus cycle; food quality; genetic screening; genomics; government regulation; heifer; infertility therapy; lactation; nonhuman; policy; prediction; pregnancy; priority journal; profit; progeny; quality control; sire; skill; socioeconomics; Animals; Breeding; Cattle; Dairy Products; Dairying; Female; Food Quality; Humans; Male; Pregnancy; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted","","","","Bauman, Dale Elton, Bovine Somatotropin: Review of an Emerging Animal Technology, Journal of Dairy Science, 75, 12, pp. 3432-3451, (1992); Bello, Nora M., Invited review: Milk production and reproductive performance: Modern interdisciplinary insights into an enduring axiom, Journal of Dairy Science, 95, 10, pp. 5461-5475, (2012); Britt, Jack H., Advances in Reproduction in Dairy Cattle, Journal of Dairy Science, 64, 6, pp. 1378-1402, (1981); Bruyère, Pierre, Can video cameras replace visual estrus detection in dairy cows?, Theriogenology, 77, 3, pp. 525-530, (2012); Caraviello, D.

A number of 19 patients had hypoplastic (HP) form, and 10 patients showed hypomaturation (HM) form of AI, while one patient showed hypocalcified form of AI and one patient had HM-HP form with taurodontism. Main complaints were chiefly related to dissatisfactory esthetics and dental sensitivity. Caries prevalence index was 93.5%. Mean decayed, missing, filling permanent teeth (DMF) and DMF surface (DMFS) were found as 2.74 ± 1.71 and 6.23 ± 3.99; df (decayed, filling primary teeth) and dfs (decayed, filling primary teeth surface) were found as 3.12 ± 2.85 and 5.24 ± 4.97, respectively. All patients received individual clinical care, including preventive, restorative, and prosthetic treatments. Patients have scheduled for regular follow-up in every 3 months. Composite restorations were used as the most common treatment (25 patients, 80.6%). The treatment plan should be based on patient's age, type of defects and individual needs of the patients. Necessary treatment plan is essential, not only due to functional and aesthetic reasons, but also for the positive psychological impact on young patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amelogenesis imperfecta; Management; Treatment","","","","","Witkop, Carl J., Amelogenesis imperfecta, dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin dysplasia revisited: problems in classification, Journal of Oral Pathology and Medicine, 17, 9-10, pp. 547-553, (1988); Yip, Hak Kong Kevin, Oral rehabilitation of young adults with amelogenesis imperfecta, International Journal of Prosthodontics, 16, 4, pp. 345-349, (2003); Indian J Dent Sci, (2013); Markovic, Dejan Lj, Case series: clinical findings and oral rehabilitation of patients with amelogenesis imperfecta., European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry, 11, 4, pp. 201-208, (2010); Int J Clin Paediatr Dent, (2011); Kwok-Tung, Law, The restorative management of amelogenesis imperfecta in the mixed dentition, Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry, 31, 2, pp. 130-135, (2006); Urzúa, Blanca O., A multidisciplinary approach for the diagnosis of hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta in two Chilean families, Acta Odontologica Scandinavica, 70, 1, pp. 7-14, (2012); Hu, Jan Ching Chun, Amelogenesis Imperfecta in Two Families with Defined AMELX Deletions in ARHGAP6, PLOS ONE, 7, 12, (2012); Cho, Sang-hyun, Novel FAM20A mutations in hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta, Human Mutation, 33, 1, pp. 91-94, (2012); Rao, S., Inherited defects in tooth structure., Birth Defects: Original Article Series, 7, 7, pp. 153-184, (1971)","","Dental Investigations Society subscription@eurjdent.com B9, Kanara Business Centre, off Link Road, Ghatkopar (E) Mumbai 400 075","","","","","","13057464; 13057456","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84916201053"

It assesses LVR-related changes in EQ-5D utilities in patients who exhibit changes in Activity Inventory (AI) measures of visual ability. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted on 77 low-vision patients out of a total of 764 patients in the parent study of ""usual care"" in LVR. Activity Inventory results were filtered for each patient to include only goals and tasks that would be targeted by LVR. RESULTS: The EQ-5D utilities have weak correlations with all AI measures but correlate best with AI goal scores at baseline (r = 0.48). Baseline goal scores are approximately normally distributed for the AI, but EQ-5D utilities at baseline are skewed toward the ceiling (median, 0.77). Effect size for EQ-5D utility change scores from pre- to post-LVR was not significantly different from zero. The AI visual function ability change scores corresponded to a moderate effect size for all functional domains and a large effect size for visual ability measures estimated from AI goal ratings. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the EQ-5D is unresponsive as an outcome measure for LVR and has poor sensitivity for discriminating low vision patients with different levels of ability. © 2013 American Academy of Optometry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","EQ-5D; low vision; outcome measures; utility; visual function","EQ-5D; Low vision; Outcome measures; utility; Visual functions; Ophthalmology; Optometers; Normal distribution; adult; aged; article; daily life activity; female; human; low vision; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; psychological aspect; quality of life; questionnaire; Sickness Impact Profile; statistics; very elderly; young adult; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Vision, Low; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Payakachat, Nalin, Predicting EQ-5D utility scores from the 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25) in patients with age-related macular degeneration, Quality of Life Research, 18, 7, pp. 801-813, (2009); Wolffsohn, James Stuart, Design of the low vision quality-of-life questionnaire (LVQOL) and measuring the outcome of low-vision rehabilitation, American Journal of Ophthalmology, 130, 6, pp. 793-802, (2000); Peacock, Stuart J., Vision and quality of life: Development of methods for the VisQoL vision-related utility instrument, Ophthalmic Epidemiology, 15, 4, pp. 218-223, (2008); Weinstein, Milton C., Recommendations of the panel on cost-effectiveness in health and medicine, JAMA, 276, 15, pp. 1253-1258, (1996); Valuing Health for Regulatory Cost Effectiveness Analysis, (2006); Devlin, Nancy Joy, Patient-reported outcome measures in the NHS: New methods for analysing and reporting EQ-5D data, Health Economics (United Kingdom), 19, 8, pp. 886-905, (2010); Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes, (1997); Torrance, George W., Health utility estimation, Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, 2, 2, pp. 99-108, (2002); Kymes, Steven M., Preference-based quality of life measures in people with visual impairment, Optometry and Vision Science, 84, 8, pp. 809-816, (2007); Kymes, Steven M., The role of preference-based measures of health states: How can we use the vision preference value scale?, Archives of Ophthalmology, 126, 12, pp. 1765-1766, (2008)","","","","","","","","15389235; 10405488","","OVSCE","23851303","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881400587"

Few studies have examined how real-life consumption patterns, including beverage type, variety and timing relate to TWI and energy intake (EI). Methods. We analysed weighed dietary records from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of 1724 British adults aged 19-64 years (2000/2001) to investigate beverage consumption patterns over 24 hrs and 7 days and associations with TWI and EI. TWI was calculated from the nutrient composition of each item of food and drink and compared with reference values. Results: Mean TWI was 2.53 L (SD 0.86) for men and 2.03 L (SD 0.71) for women, close to the European Food Safety Authority ""adequate Intake"" (AI) of 2.5 L and 2 L, respectively. However, for 33% of men and 23% of women TWI was below AI and TWI:EI ratio was <1 g/kcal. Beverages accounted for 75% of TWI. Beverage variety was correlated with TWI (r 0.34) and more weakly with EI (r 0.16). Beverage consumption peaked at 0800 hrs (mainly hot beverages/ milk) and 2100 hrs (mainly alcohol). Total beverage consumption was higher at weekends, especially among men. Overall, beverages supplied 16% of EI (men 17%, women 14%), alcoholic drinks contributed 9% (men) and 5% (women), milk 5-6%, caloric soft drinks 2%, and fruit juice 1%.In multi-variable regression (adjusted for sex, age, body weight, smoking, dieting, activity level and mis-reporting), replacing 100 g of caloric beverages (milk, fruit juice, caloric soft drinks and alcohol) with 100 g non-caloric drinks (diet soft drinks, hot beverages and water) was associated with a reduction in EI of 15 kcal, or 34 kcal if food energy were unchanged. Using within-person data (deviations from 7-day mean) each 100 g change in caloric beverages was associated with 29 kcal change in EI or 35 kcal if food energy were constant. By comparison the calculated energy content of caloric drinks consumed was 47 kcal/100 g. Conclusions: TWI and beverage consumption are closely related, and some individuals appeared to have low TWI. Compensation for energy from beverages may occur but is partial. A better understanding of interactions between drinking and eating habits and their impact on water and energy balance would give a firmer basis to dietary recommendations. © 2013 Gibson and Shirreffs; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Adults; Beverage consumption; Dietary patterns; Energy; Water intake","adult; alcoholic beverage; article; beverage; caloric intake; carbonated beverage; dietary intake; drinking; eating habit; female; fluid intake; food composition; food intake; fruit juice; health survey; human; male; milk; normal human; nutrient; sex difference; Adult; Beverages; Body Weight; Diet Records; Drinking; Energy Intake; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Food Habits; Great Britain; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Nutrition Surveys; Questionnaires; Young Adult","","","","Jéquier, Eric, Water as an essential nutrient: The physiological basis of hydration, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 64, 2, pp. 115-123, (2010); Benelam, Bridget, Hydration and health: A review, Nutrition Bulletin, 35, 1, pp. 3-25, (2010); Popkin, Barry Michael, Water, hydration, and health, Nutrition Reviews, 68, 8, pp. 439-458, (2010); Efsa J, (2010); Dietary reference intakes for water, potassium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate, pp. 1-617, (2005); Nutrients in Drinking Water, (2005); Kant, Ashima K., Intakes of plain water, moisture in foods and beverages, and total water in the adult US population-nutritional, meal pattern, and body weight correlates: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999-2006, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 90, 3, pp. 655-663, (2009); Gibson, Sigrid A., Hydration, water intake and beverage consumption habits among adults, Nutrition Bulletin, 37, 3, pp. 182-192, (2012); Ng, Shuwen, Patterns and trends of beverage consumption among children and adults in Great Britain, 1986-2009, British Journal of Nutrition, 108, 3, pp. 536-551, (2012); Riksmaten 1997 1998 Dietary Habits and Nutrient Intake in Sweden","","","","","","","","14752891","","","23305461","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872115588"

Young adults with a foundation of positive traits in these domains will be best prepared for the transition to college and future independence. However, for some adolescents with nonverbal learning disorder (NVLD), the transition to independence can present challenges. Resilience traits that youth develop over time will have a significant effect on developmental outcomes (Rutter, 1987). For those who plan to attend college some predictive traits of those students who will be successful include a good academic self-concept, high educational aspirations, positive mental health, emotional maturity, independent living, and self-advocacy skills.

Using data from a small randomized trial designed to reduce diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among overweight/obese AI/ANs, we evaluated the impact of an adapted HGHH curriculum on cardiovascular knowledge. We also assessed whether the curriculum was effective across levels of health literacy (defined as the 'capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions'). We examined change in knowledge from baseline to 3 months for two groups: HGHH (N = 89) and control (N = 50). Compared with controls, HGHH participants showed significant improvement in heart attack knowledge and marginally significant improvement in stroke and general CVD knowledge. HGHH participants attending ≥1 class showed significantly greater improvement than controls on all three measures. Although HGHH participants with inadequate health literacy had worse heart attack and stroke knowledge at baseline and 3 months than did participants with adequate skills, the degree of improvement in knowledge did not differ by health literacy level.

Findings: Substantial proportions of AI women in our sample were behind the recommended schedules of screening for breast and cervical cancer. Adjusted estimates revealed that perceived discrimination was significantly associated with not being current for clinical breast examination and Pap test, and was close to statistical significance with not being current for mammography. The number of suboptimal health care-seeking behaviors increased with higher mean levels of perceived discrimination. Conclusions: Among AI women, perceived discrimination in health care may negatively influence use of breast and cancer screening services, and health care-seeking behaviors. More research is needed among AIs to examine features of health care systems related to the phenomenon patients perceived experience of discrimination. © 2013 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","","adult; American Indian; article; breast cancer; breast examination; cancer epidemiology; cancer screening; data analysis; female; health care access; health care disparity; health care planning; health care quality; health impact assessment; health service; help seeking behavior; human; major clinical study; mammography; medical record; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Papanicolaou test; patient attitude; personal experience; self report; statistical significance; uterine cervix cancer; women's health; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Discrimination (Psychology); Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Logistic Models; Mammography; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Perception; Prejudice; Questionnaires; Socioeconomic Factors; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Smears; Young Adult","","","This research was supported by a number of awards received by Dr. Gonzales including: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Award Number F31DK082279 ; National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant no.

All data regarding patients with a diagnosis of certain/suspected Al were collected and evaluated: some demographic information, the characteristics of the agent involved, the pattern of exposure, the triage at the admission to TUC and the outcome. 244 cases were analyzed: 45.9% males and 54.9% females, mean age respectively 45.1 and 43.9 years. The monthly distribution of admitted patients resulted fairly constant, except from a light rising prevalence in autumn, with a majority of yellow (45.9%) and green (43.4%) triage code. The pattern of exposure resulted: ingestion (82.7% of cases; age peaks: 18-34 and 35-51 years old; mostly due to food (as mushrooms), drinks, detergents, soap, pharmaceutical, drugs of abuse, caustics substances), contact (10.2% of cases; age peak 18-51) and inhalation (6.9% of cases). In 17.2% of cases the poisoning exposure was intentional. In 63.5% the patients were sent to their general practitioners (45.5% of the yellow and 81.1% of the green coded patients) and in 22.1% of cases they were admitted to clinical rooms (44.6% of the yellow coded patients). In most cases the triage code assigned to the studied patients resulted yellow and green. Considering that the seriousness of the symptoms can appear after several hours from the exposure to toxic substances, a quick and specific intervention to obtain the best therapeutical effectiveness is suitable, in order to save lives or to avoid irremediable health damages. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Acute intoxication; Emergency department; Epidemiology; Italy","detergent; soap; adult; age distribution; article; autumn; drug intoxication; female; hospital admission; human; inhalation; intoxication; Italy; major clinical study; male; mushroom poisoning; outcome assessment; retrospective study; sex difference; Acute Disease; Adult; Age Distribution; Caustics; Ethanol; Female; Humans; Intensive Care; Intensive Care Units; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Admission; Pesticides; Poisoning; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution; Suicide, Attempted; Toxicology; Young Adult","","Caustics, 0; Ethanol, 64-17-5; Pesticides, 0","","Poisoning Prevention and Management; undefined, (2012); Watson, William A., 2004 Annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System, American Journal of Emergency Medicine, 23, 5, pp. 589-666, (2005); Bronstein, Alvin C., 2008 Annual report of the American association of poison control centers' national poison data system (NPDS): 26th annual report AAPCC 2009 annual report of the NPDS, Clinical Toxicology, 47, 10, pp. 911-1084, (2009); undefined, (2012); Caballero Vallés, Pedro J., Epidemiologic survey of acute poisoning in the south area of the community of Madrid.

There are few studies that investigate the effectiveness of reading aloud to young children. Objectives - To analyze the parental attitude to reading aloud to young children in the Apulia region and evaluate the effectiveness of ""Born to Read"" (""Nati per Leggere"", NPL) programme, promoted by the Regional Department of Health. Materials and methods - 144 paediatricians, trained through specific meetings, gave a questionnaire inspired by the BABAR (Before and After Books and Reading) to parents. The programme included the gift of books suitable for ages between 0-36 months and advice on the importance of reading to children since the first months of life. Two years later the same questionnaire was given to the same parents. Results - The pre-intervention data collected in the 6 provinces of the Region showed that the attitude to reading aloud to young children was present in only 17% of households in the Apulia Region. The post intervention assessment, carried out two years later, showed that the attitude to reading aloud increased. The results connected to the maternal and paternal education are also interesting. Even the mother's age at first pregnancy over 18 is associated with a statistically significant attitude to reading aloud. Conclusion - The ""Born to Read"" programme seems to have a positive impact on the parents' attitude to reading aloud to their young children. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Born to read; Family literacy; Family paediatricians; Reading aloud","child; child health care; clinical effectiveness; disease classification; health program; human; maternal age; outcome assessment; parental attitude; parenting education; pregnancy; reading; short survey","","","","","","","","","","","","15913090","","MBAMF","","Italian","Short survey","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859551522"

This study investigated the emotional impact of the University of North Dakota's ""Fighting Sioux"" nickname/logo on 33 AI and 36 majority culture (MC) students enrolled at the university. Participants completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist-Revised (MAACL-R) before viewing two slide presentations of Fighting Sioux-related images: one neutral (i.e., non-controversial) and one controversial. Participants completed the MAACL-R after each presentation. They also completed the Nickname and Logo Distress Scale, and AI participants completed the Northern Plains Biculturalism Inventory to assess their degree of cultural orientation. Results showed that AIs experienced higher negative affect following both slide presentations than did MC participants. MC participants' affect was only changed following the controversial slide presentation. The findings suggest AI students may experience significantly higher levels of psychological distress when viewing even neutral images of AI nicknames/logos. © Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","adult; American Indian; article; comparative study; cultural anthropology; female; human; male; mental stress; nomenclature; psychological aspect; sport; student; United States; Culture; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Names; North Dakota; Sports; Stress, Psychological; Students; Young Adult","","","","Northern Plains Bicultural Immersion Scale Preliminary Manual and Scoring Instructions Version 5, (1994); Families in Society the Journal of Contemporary Human Services, (1992); Dissertation Abstracts International, (1996); Handbook of Multicultural Counseling, (1995); Indian Historian, (1978); Davis, Laurel R., Protest against the use of native american mascots: A challenge to traditional american identity, Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 17, 1, pp. 9-22, (1993); Journal of Humanics, (1979); American Indian Culture and Research Journal, (1987); Journal of American Indian Education, (1991); Differences in Level of Sport Spectator Identification and Sport Fan Motivation Among American Indian and Caucasian College Students, (2002)","","","","","","","","08935394; 15337731","","","22302279","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861175884"

Purpose This study aimed to investigate a potential area of focus for HIV prevention interventions by assessing the impact of sexual risk cognitions on sexual risk-taking among AI/AN MSM. Methods AI/AN MSM (N=173) from a national crosssectional survey were analyzed. Results Reporting more frequent sexual risk cognitions overall (high sexual risk cognitions) was associated with multiple HIV risk factors including unprotected anal intercourse and serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse. Participants with high sexual risk cognitions had a 2.3 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.1, 4.7) times greater odds of engaging in unprotected anal intercourse regardless of childhood sexual abuse, depression, and alcohol dependence. Most individual sexual risk cognitions were associated with unprotected anal intercourse, serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse, or both.

Methods: The authors used data from central cancer registries linked to Indian Health Service (IHS) patient registration database, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, IHS National Data Warehouse, and the National Hospital Discharge Survey. Cancer incidence rates were adjusted for hysterectomy and oophorectomy prevalence and presented by region for non-Hispanic White (NHW) and AI/AN women. Results: AI/AN women had a higher prevalence of hysterectomy (23.1%) compared with NHW women (20.9%). Correcting cancer rates for population-at-risk significantly increased the cancer incidence rates among AI/AN women: 43% for cervical cancer, 67% for uterine cancer, and 37% for ovarian cancer. Risk-correction led to increased differences in cervical cancer incidence between AI/AN and NHW women in certain regions. Conclusions: Current reporting of cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancer underestimates the incidence in women at risk and can affect the measure of cancer disparities. Improved cancer surveillance using methodology to correct for population-at-risk may better inform disease control priorities for AI/AN populations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Urinary incontinence (UI) was previously documented, but few data are available about anal incontinence (AI) in female athletes. Our aim was to determine the role of high-level sport practice on AI in a young, healthy female population. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included women aged 18-40 years. Self-administered questionnaires were delivered to each female volunteer. Two groups were defined: (1) intensive sport (IS) group: high-level sport (>8 hours weekly), and (2) nonintensive sport (NIS) group: all other subjects. Results: Of the 393 women enrolled, 169 were in the IS group and 224 were in the NIS group. Women of the IS group were significantly younger than the others (21.74±4.28 vs. 24.87±5.61 years, p<0.001) and had less births (0.07±0.31 vs. 0.20±0.62, p=0.005). The prevalence of AI was statistically higher in the IS group than in the NIS group (14.8% vs. 4.9%, p=0.001), as was UI (33.1% vs. 18.3%, p=0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that IS practice (odds ratio [OR] 2.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-6.87, p=0.010) and body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28, p=0.033) were significantly linked to AI when taking into account major confounding factors (age and births). In the IS group, AI was mainly represented by loss of flatus in 84%. Conclusions: High-level sport appears to be a significant independent risk factor for AI in healthy young women. These results suggest that preventive measures, such as pelvic floor muscle training, may be proposed for this young population. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","","adult; article; birth; body mass; cross-sectional study; feces incontinence; female; flatulence; human; pelvic floor muscle training; physical activity; physiotherapy; priority journal; questionnaire; risk factor; sport; Adolescent; Adult; Athletes; Constipation; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dyspareunia; Fecal Incontinence; Female; France; Humans; Logistic Models; Pelvic Floor; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Sports; Students; Universities; Urinary Incontinence; Young Adult","","","","Brown, Wendy J., Updating the Evidence on Physical Activity and Health in Women, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 33, 5, pp. 404-e25, (2007); Janz, Kathleen F., Tracking physical fitness and physical activity from childhood to adolescence: The Muscatine study, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 32, 7, pp. 1250-1257, (2000); Leon, Arthur S., Leisure-Time Physical Activity Levels and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Death: The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, JAMA, 258, 17, pp. 2388-2395, (1987); Blair, Steven N., Physical Fitness and Incidence of Hypertension in Healthy Normotensive Men and Women, JAMA, 252, 4, pp. 487-490, (1984); Snow-Harter, Christine M., Exercise, bone mineral density, and osteoporosis, Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews, 19, 1, pp. 351-388, (1991); Helmrich, Susan P., Physical Activity and Reduced Occurrence of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, New England Journal of Medicine, 325, 3, pp. 147-152, (1991); Taylor, Craig Barr, The relation of physical activity and exercise to mental health, Public Health Reports, 100, 2, pp. 195-202, (1985); King, Abby C., Influence of regular aerobic exercise on psychological health: a randomized, controlled trial of healthy middle-aged adults., Health Psychology, 8, 3, pp. 305-324, (1989); Kruger, Judy M.S., Prevalence of regular physical activity among adults - United States, 2001 and 2005, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 56, 46, pp. 1209-1212, (2007); Joy, Elizabeth A., Health-related concerns of the female athlete: A lifespan approach, American Family Physician, 79, 6, pp. 489-495, (2009)","","","","","","","","15409996; 1931843X","","JWHOA","21501085","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957521305"

One area that this is especially evident is in the epidemic of diabetes in North America's American Indians (AIs) - who evidence higher prevalence rates and concomitant disease-related complications than any other racial/ethnic group. As researchers and AI communities work together to transcend conventional top-down, service-delivery approaches to care, community-based participatory research is beginning to show promise as a way to partner contemporary biomedical knowledge with the lived-experience, wisdom, and customs of Indigenous people. This study describes the Family Education Diabetes Series (FEDS) as an example of such effort, and highlights pilot findings assessing its value and impact across key diabetes-relevant variables. Following 36 intervention participants across baseline, 3-month, and 6-month time periods, data show significant improvements in weight, blood pressure, and metabolic control (A1c). Strengths and limitations of this investigation are presented, along with suggestions about how to further advance and empirically test the work across other Indigenous communities. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","Action research; American Indians; Community-based participatory research; Diabetes; Indigenous people; Obesity","adult; aged; American Indian; article; demography; diabetes mellitus; ethnology; family health; female; health care quality; human; male; methodology; middle aged; obesity; participatory research; patient education; pilot study; program development; social psychology; statistics; United States; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Community-Based Participatory Research; Diabetes Mellitus; Family Health; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Midwestern United States; Obesity; Patient Education as Topic; Pilot Projects; Prejudice; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Residence Characteristics; Statistics as Topic; Young Adult","","","","Community Based Participatory Research Assessing the Evidence, (2004); undefined, (2010); Baum, Fran Elaine, Participatory action research, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 60, 10, pp. 854-857, (2006); Comparative Similarities and Differences Between Action Research Participative Research and Participatory Action Research, (2004); Berge, Jerica Mohlman, Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) to target health disparities in families, Family Relations, 58, 4, pp. 475-488, (2009); Bindon, James R., Bergmann's rule and the thrifty genotype, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 104, 2, pp. 201-210, (1997); Bogart, Laura M., Community-Based Participatory Research: Partnering With Communities for Effective and Sustainable Behavioral Health Interventions, Health Psychology, 28, 4, pp. 391-393, (2009); Bradbury-Huang, Hilary, Action Research: An Opportunity for Revitalizing Research Purpose and Practices, Qualitative Social Work, 2, 2, pp. 155-175, (2003); Braithwaite, Rhonda, Insider participatory action research in disadvantaged post-industrial areas: The experiences of community members as they become Community Based Action Researchers, Action Research, 5, 1, pp. 61-74, (2007); Brugge, Doug M., Community-based participatory research in boston's neighborhoods: A review of asthma case examples, Archives of Environmental and Occupational Health, 65, 1, pp. 38-44, (2010)","","","","","","","","14401800; 13207881","","","21059153","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78149379718"

Our aim was to determine the incidence, predictive factors and impact of ICU-AIs in ICU patients in Tunisia. Material/Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study over a 3 month period in the medical surgical intensive care unit of Habib Bourguiba University Hospital (Sfax-Tunisia). Results: During the study period 261 patients were surveyed; 44 of them (16.9%) developed 55 episodes of ICU-AI (34.7 ICU-AI/1000 days of hospitalization). The most frequently identified infections were ventilator-associated pneumoniae (58.2%), and primary bloodstream infection (18.2%). The most frequently isolated organisms were multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (44.7%), and A. baumannii (21.3%). The initial antibiotic prescription for ICU-AI was inadequate in 9 cases (16.4% of episodes of ICU-AI). At ICU discharge, overall mortality was 29.9%. Independent risk factors for acquiring infection in ICU were the use of central venous catheter (p=0.014) and antibiotic prescription on admission for more than 24 hours (p=0.025), those of mortality in ICU were SAPS II of more than 35 points (p<0.001) and ICU-AI (p=0.002), and those of mortality at 28 days after an episode of ICU-AI were septic shock (p=0.004) and inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment (p=0.011). Conclusions: We conclude that the occurrence of ICU-AI is significantly related to increased mortality, and that focusing interventions on better use of antibiotics would have a benefit in terms of prevention and consequences of ICU-AI. © Med Sci Monit, 2010. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antibiotics; Intensive care unit; Mortality; Nosocomial infection; Prevention","amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; carbapenem derivative; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; colistin; amoxicillin; Acinetobacter baumannii; adolescent; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; article; bacterium identification; bloodstream infection; central venous catheter; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; health survey; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospital infection; hospitalization; human; incidence; infection risk; intensive care unit; major clinical study; male; mortality; observational study; prescription; prospective study; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; septic shock; treatment outcome; Tunisia; university hospital; ventilator associated pneumonia; bacterium; cross infection; infant; isolation and purification; Kaplan Meier method; microbiology; middle aged; preschool child; risk factor; antimicrobial therapy; catheter infection; cause of death; device infection; drug treatment failure; Enterobacter aerogenes; isolated organ; Klebsiella pneumoniae; length of stay; multidrug resistance; multiple trauma; outcome assessment; primary infection; Proteus mirabilis; respiratory failure; resuscitation; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteria; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross Infection; Female; Humans; Infant; Intensive Care Units; Kaplan-Meiers Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","","amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 74469-00-4, 79198-29-1; cefotaxime, 63527-52-6, 64485-93-4; ceftazidime, 72558-82-8; ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1; colistin, 1066-17-7, 1264-72-8; amoxicillin, 26787-78-0, 34642-77-8, 61336-70-7","","Vincent, Jean Louis, The Prevalence of Nosocomial Infection in Intensive Care Units in Europe: Results of the European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC) Study, JAMA, 274, 8, pp. 639-644, (1995); Richards, Michael J., Nosocomial infections in medical intensive care units in the United States, Critical Care Medicine, 27, 5, pp. 887-892, (1999); Alberti, Corinne, Epidemiology of sepsis and infection in ICU patients from an international multicentre cohort study, Intensive Care Medicine, 28, 2, pp. 108-121, (2002); Çevik, Mustafa Aydin, Relationship between nosocomial infection and mortality in a neurology intensive care unit in Turkey, Journal of Hospital Infection, 59, 4, pp. 324-330, (2005); Vosylius, Saulius, Intensive care unit acquired infection: A prevalence and impact on morbidity and mortality, Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica, 47, 9, pp. 1132-1137, (2003); Legras, Annick, Nosocomial infections: Prospective survey of incidence in five French intensive care units, Intensive Care Medicine, 24, 10, pp. 1040-1046, (1998); Luzzati, Roberto, Prevalence of nosocomial infections in Intensive Care Units in Triveneto area, Italy, Minerva Anestesiologica, 67, 9, pp. 647-652, (2001); Toufen Júnior, Carlos, Prevalence rates of infection in intensive care units of a tertiary teaching hospital., Revista do Hospital das Clinicas de Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo, 58, 5, pp. 254-259, (2003); Esen, Şaban, Prevalence of nosocomial infections at intensive care units in Turkey: A multicentre 1-day point prevalence study, Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases, 36, 2, pp. 144-148, (2004); Reed, Caroline S., Hospital infection control in Australia, Journal of Hospital Infection, 54, 4, pp. 267-271, (2003)","","","","","","","","15076164","","","20671622","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955350774"

This report updates the information on HPV-associated female genital cancer incidence with more recent data, adds information on trends, and includes American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. We used combined data from two federal cancer surveillance programs, CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, covering 92% of the U.S. population from 1999 to 2004, to examine recent trends and incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma and vaginal and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Incidence of in situ vaginal and vulvar SCC are also presented. The average annual age-adjusted rate of cervical cancer among women of all races/ethnicities was 8.5/100,000. Annual cervical cancer incidence rates were highest but declined more rapidly among Hispanic and black women compared with non-Hispanic and white women. The rate of vulvar cancer among all women was 1.7/100,000 and was higher among white women than other racial groups. Vulvar cancer rates rose among black women (+2.9% per year) and were relatively stable among all other racial and ethnic groups over the 6-year period. Vaginal cancer was rare (rate 0.5/100,000); the rate was higher among black women than other racial groups and higher among Hispanic women than among non-Hispanic women. A significant decline of vaginal cancer was observed only among black women (-6.2% per year). This article confirms previous findings on racial disparities in HPV-associated female genital cancers. Any post-HPV vaccine declines in these cancers should be interpreted in light of current declines. Enhancing current cancer surveillance systems, combined with special studies to collect data on in situ or precancerous lesions of these cancers, will provide important information in determining the potential impact of the HPV vaccine. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","","adolescent; adult; aged; article; cancer epidemiology; cancer patient; cancer registry; child; ethnicity; female; gynecologic cancer; health program; human; major clinical study; preschool child; priority journal; school child; uterine cervix cancer; vulva cancer; Wart virus; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Ethnic Groups; Female; Genital Neoplasms, Female; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Prognosis; United States; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Vaginal Neoplasms; Vulvar Neoplasms; Women's Health; Young Adult","","Papillomavirus Vaccines, 0","","Walboomers, Jan M.M., Human papillomavirus is a necessary cause of invasive cervical cancer worldwide, Journal of Pathology, 189, 1, pp. 12-19, (1999); Parkin, Donald Maxwell, Chapter 2: The burden of HPV-related cancers, Vaccine, 24, SUPPL. 3, pp. S11-S25, (2006); Muñoz, Nubia, Chapter 1: HPV in the etiology of human cancer, Vaccine, 24, SUPPL. 3, pp. S1-S10, (2006); Insinga, Ralph P., A systematic review of the prevalence and attribution of human papillomavirus types among cervical, vaginal, and vulvar precancers and cancers in the United States, Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention, 17, 7, pp. 1611-1622, (2008); FDA Approves Expanded Uses for Gardasil to Include Preventing Certain Vulvar and Vaginal Cancers, (2008); Watson, Meg, Using population-based cancer registry data to assess the burden of human papillomavirus-associated cancers in the United States: Overview of methods, Cancer, 113, 10 SUPPL., pp. 2841-2854, (2008); United States Cancer Statistics 2004 Incidence and Mortality, (2007); Espey, David K., Methods for improving cancer surveillance data in American Indian and Alaska Native populations, Cancer, 113, 5 SUPPL., pp. 1120-1130, (2008); Naaccr Guideline for Enhancing Hispanic Latino Identification Revised Naaccr Hispanic Latino Identification Algorithm Nhia V2, (2005); Tiwari, Ram Chandra, Efficient interval estimation for age-adjusted cancer rates, Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 15, 6, pp. 547-569, (2006)","","","","","","","","15409996; 1931843X","","JWHOA","19951205","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-71449083807"

To reduce this disparity, Indian Health Service (IHS) staff developed, pilot-tested, and implemented Ride Safe, which provided education, training, and child safety seats for children aged 3-5 participating in Tribal Head Start Centers. Methods: Focus groups, key informant interviews, and technical review guided program development and implementation. Progress reports and child safety seat use observations, conducted at the beginning and end of three program years (Fall 2003 to Spring 2006), assessed program reach and impact. To examine CSS use, we used three multiple logistic regressions, including a conservative intent to treat analysis. Results: Ride Safe reached approximately 3,500 children and their families at 14 sites in six states, providing over 1,700 parents/family members with educational activities, 2,916 child safety seats, and child passenger safety (CPS) technician certification training for 78 Tribal staff. Children were 2.5 times (OR = 2.55, p < .01) as likely to be observed in child safety seats comparing Rounds 1 and 2 data, with the most conservative model showing that the odds of being observed restrained were 74% higher (OR = 1.74, p = <.01) after implementation of the program. Conclusions: The Ride Safe Program effectively increased child safety seat use in AI/AN communities, however, observed use rates ranging from 30% to 71% remain well below the 2006 all US rate of 93%. Results from CSS educational and distribution/installation programs such as Ride Safe should be considered in light of the need to increase distribution programs and enhance enforcement activities in AI/AN communities, thereby reducing the disparity in AI/AN motor vehicle injuries and death. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","American Indian/Alaska Native; Child passenger safety; Health disparities; Implementation and evaluation; Program development","American Indian; article; child safety; health education; health program; human; information dissemination; intervention study; outcome assessment; preschool child; priority journal; seatbelt; traffic safety; United States; Adolescent; Automobile Driving; Child; Child, Preschool; Confidence Intervals; Female; Focus Groups; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inuits; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Safety; Seat Belts; United States Indian Health Service; Young Adult","","","We wish to thank teachers, administrators, and other staff working in American Indian/Alaska Native Head Start Centers who have participated in the Ride Safe Program.

There are 5 major AI companies in the United States today: 3 large cooperatives, 1 private company, and 1 public company. The latter 2 have majority ownership outside of the United States. The AI industry in the United States progeny-tests more than 1,000 Holstein young sires per year. Because healthy, mature dairy bulls are capable of producing well over 100,000 straws of frozen semen per year, only a relatively small number of bulls are needed to breed the world's population of dairy cows. Most AI companies in the United States do not own many, if any, females and tend to utilize the same maternal families in their breeding programs. Little differences exist among the selection programs of the AI companies in the United States. The similarity of breeding programs and the extreme semen-production capabilities of bulls have contributed to difficulties the AI companies have had in developing genetically different product lines. Exports of North American Holstein genetics increased steadily from the 1970s into the 1990s because of the perceived superiority of North American Holsteins for dairy traits compared with European strains, especially for production. The breeding industry moved towards international genetic evaluations of bulls in the 1990s, with the International Bull Evaluation Service (Interbull) in Sweden coordinating the evaluations. The extensive exchange of elite genetics has led to a global dairy genetics industry with bulls that are closely related, and the average inbreeding level for the major dairy breeds continues to increase. Genetic markers have been used extensively and successfully by the industry for qualitative traits, especially for recessive genetic disorders, but markers have had limited impact for quantitative traits. Selection emphasis continues to migrate away from production traits and towards nonproduction traits, especially towards health and fitness traits. Specifically, fertility has arguably become the major breeding and management issue facing dairy farmers today. Some producers have implemented crossbreeding programs in an effort to capitalize on heterosis, and crossbreeding will almost certainly need to be a bigger part of the AI companies business in the years ahead. © American Dairy Science Association, 2006. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic marker; Inbreeding; Interbull; Progeny test","Bos taurus; animal; animal disease; artificial insemination; breeding; cattle; commercial phenomena; cross breeding; cryopreservation; dairying; embryo transfer; female; genetic marker; genetic selection; genetics; inbreeding; international cooperation; male; methodology; pedigree; pregnancy; quantitative trait; review; sperm; sperm preservation; United States; Animals; Breeding; Cattle; Commerce; Crosses, Genetic; Cryopreservation; Dairying; Embryo Transfer; Female; Genetic Markers; Inbreeding; Insemination, Artificial; International Cooperation; Male; Pedigree; Pregnancy; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Selection (Genetics); Semen; Semen Preservation","","Genetic Markers, 0","","Ashwell, Melissa S., A genome scan to identify quantitative trait loci affecting economically important traits in a US Holstein population, Journal of Dairy Science, 84, 11, pp. 2535-2542, (2001); DeJarnette, James Mel, Sustaining the fertility of artificially inseminated dairy cattle: The role of the artificial insemination industry, Journal of Dairy Science, 87, SUPPL. 1, pp. E93-E104, (2004); Foote, Robert H., Review: Dairy Cattle Reproductive Physiology Research and Management - Past Progress and Future Prospects, Journal of Dairy Science, 79, 6, pp. 980-990, (1996); Hansen, Leslie B., Consequences of selection for milk yield from a geneticist's viewpoint, Journal of Dairy Science, 83, 5, pp. 1145-1150, (2000); Hasler, John F., Current Status and Potential of Embryo Transfer and Reproductive Technology in Dairy Cattle, Journal of Dairy Science, 75, 10, pp. 2857-2879, (1992); Meinert, T.

Three waves of data from an ethnically diverse community sample of women, assessed over 16 years are used to study how various psychosocial factors in adolescence influenced later drinking, depression, and their shared association. Structural equation models revealed that several adolescent ecodevelopmental and social development model variables influenced their later outcome in young adulthood and adulthood. The strongest relation was between adolescent Social Conformity and adult AD (β = -.46) over a 16-year period, emphasizing the impact of this construct. Numerous other relations were revealed. For instance, less satisfaction with school during adolescence predicted adult AI. Having a good bond to the family in adolescence predicted a lower quantity of alcohol consumed during adulthood. Lower satisfaction with ""what you want to be"" during adolescence predicted young adult D. Higher levels of adolescent relationship satisfaction and school satisfaction predicted less suicidal ideation as an adult. Prevention interventions focusing on increasing socially conforming attitudes and on strengthening relationships both in and out of the home during adolescence are likely to be effective in reducing aspects of AI, D, and AD for women in the general community. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.","adolescent predictors; alcohol; comorbidity; depression; women","adolescent; adult; alcohol consumption; article; controlled study; drinking behavior; dysphoria; ethnology; family; female; human; prediction; satisfaction; school; social evolution; social psychology; Adolescent; Adolescent Psychology; Adult; Age Factors; Alcohol Drinking; Attitude to Health; Causality; Comorbidity; Depression; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Family; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Los Angeles; Models, Psychological; Personal Satisfaction; Predictive Value of Tests; Risk Factors; Self Concept; Social Conformity; Suicide; Women","","","","Barnett, Peter A., Psychosocial Functioning and Depression: Distinguishing Among Antecedents, Concomitants, and Consequences, Psychological Bulletin, 104, 1, pp. 97-126, (1988); Cognitive Therapy of Depression, (1979); Alcohol Problems in Women, (1984); Bentler, Peter M., Comparative fit indexes in structural models, Psychological Bulletin, 107, 2, pp. 238-246, (1990); Billings, Andrew G., Social-environmental factors in unipolar depression: Comparisons of depressed patients and nondepressed controls, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 92, 2, pp. 119-133, (1983); Blume, Sheila B., Chemical dependency in women: Important issues, American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, 16, 3-4, pp. 297-307, (1990); Brook, Judith Suzanne, The psychosocial etiology of adolescent drug use: a family interactional approach., Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 116, 2, pp. 111-267, (1990); Brook, Judith Suzanne, Initiation into adolescent marijuana use, Journal of Genetic Psychology, 137, 1, pp. 133-142, (1980); Testing Structural Equation Models, (1993); Burch, Earl A., Suicide attempt histories in alcohol-dependent men: Differences in psychological profiles, Substance Use and Misuse, 29, 11, pp. 1477-1486, (1994)","","","","","","","","13894986; 15736695","","","15470936","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4344591347"

We have investigated whether sleep apnoea in the elderly is associated with more arousals compared with younger people. Additionally, the impact of arousals on daytime symptoms was noted. Four groups (n=11) of elderly (>65 years) and young (<39 years) apnoeic (EA and YA), and age-matched non-apnoeics (EN and YN) were studied. The arousal index (AI) and apnoea/hypopnoea index were determined from polysomnography. Sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and Quality of life (QoL, SF-36) were assessed. The mean (SD) A was: EN 23.1 (7.6), EA 46.5 (8.8), YN 13.2 (6.6), YA 38.5 (12.1) events/h. AI was higher in the elderly (P=0.002) and in apnoeics (P=0.001); however, the increase in AI associated with sleep apnoea was not age dependent (P=0.73). The influence of sleep apnoea on sleepiness was similar in both age groups. YA but not EA reported reduced physical functioning (P=0.04), vitality (P=0.007) and general health (P=0.04) compared to non-apnoeics. We conclude that (1) the effect of sleep apnoea on arousal is no greater in the elderly compared to the young (2) despite similar levels of sleepiness, elderly apneoics perceive a reduced loss of QoL compared to younger patients. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arousals; Daytime sleepiness; Sleep-disordered breathing","adult; age; aged; arousal; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; groups by age; human; hyperventilation; hypocapnia; intermethod comparison; male; polysomnography; priority journal; quality of life; rating scale; sleep apnea syndrome; symptomatology","","","","Mathur, Rajat, Frequency of EGG arousals from nocturnal sleep in normal subjects, Sleep, 18, 5, pp. 330-333, (1995); Boselli, Mirella, Effect of Age on EEG Arousals in Normal Sleep, Sleep, 21, 4, pp. 351-357, (1998); Carskadon, Mary A., Respiration during sleep in the aged human, Journals of Gerontology, 36, 4, pp. 420-423, (1981); Krieger, Jean Paul, Breathing during sleep in normal young and elderly subjects: Hypopneas, apneas, and correlated factors, Sleep, 6, 2, pp. 108-120, (1983); Ancoli-Israel, Sonia, Sleep-disordered breathing in community-dwelling elderly, Sleep, 14, 6, pp. 486-495, (1991); Bixler, Edward O., Effects of age on sleep apnea in men.
